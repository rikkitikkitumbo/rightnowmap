SUBTERFUGE shows characters in midsts of deception and foul play, showing that nothing is as it appears to be\u2026\n\nBorn and raised in the Bronx, NY, and alum of the School of Visual Arts, Tina lives and works in Portland, OR creating lush and grotesque paintings on enamel and plexiglass. Tina\u2019s work has gained an incredible following in both the art world as well as social media due to her high level of craft and her work\u2019s confrontational and satirical beauty. From her bio:\n\n\"Inculcated by waves of Saturday morning cartoons, characters portrayed in comic book literature, and videogame culture, Tina Lugo became instantly infatuated with the bright colors of the animated world\u2026 Lugo lists as her biggest influence the Ero Guru Nansensu art movement of Japan\u2014a name comprised of fractions of the English words erotic, grotesque, and nonsense. The movement focuses on eroticism, sexual corruption, and decadence, all themes salient in Lugo's work. With the complex compositions of her paintings, often it takes a few moments before the viewer sees the nudity or eroticism in her paintings, something she thinks eases people into the sexual nature of her pieces.\"\n\nIn addition to Tina\u2019s original works on our walls, we will also feature some of Lugo\u2019s original collectible enamel pins. SUBTERFUGE opens Thursday, January 26th with a reception from 5 to 7 PM and will remain up for view through Monday, February 20th. Work will be available to purchase both in the gallery as well as on Screaming Sky\u2019s website.\n\nFind out more about Tina Lugo at tinalugo.com.\n\nKeep up to date on more events as well as our art & artists via screamingskypdx.com!"}],"paginationCursor":"eyJzdGFydF90aW1lIjoxNDg1NDE3NjAwLCJlbmRfdGltZSI6MTQ4NTUwMzk5OSwiYnJvd3NlX2N1cnNvciI6IkFicmVHeW9WQ1ZmTDh4NmFVelhqYU5PQktJWDRiVzE5NXZRQWRLd1IzZlVlQU00a0tkSzBOODUyYkE0RVpuR3FNNVl6eFhyODZ6UlBkamdyZjg0bFpiUXpkUXlFVkpzSWtQbWFWcWpBZnVPd3pNcVF4bnZxZU51WEJPb1psaGpOWXZSeUJSMndwYUxlSjI0X1JNZm1kTzQ5LXZqWERXVkg3S0Y1QXE2cDV3S0RHa25mTnJBTExGaFp4WTgtS2Q4UURHYm5nQVRuU09PTWRfbm92R2NUYW1qdXQ0R2I3dzZmc2F5bTZId2h3R1BvVTZoeUVjZGp3R3EyeE93S3pfVHFaODZ1ZWYzNFlFdkxGS2NmR3BMOGxVNDR1OThYa3dIZllLbWNPTGgxbG1zdW9BIn0=","hasNextPage":true}],"isGroupedList":false},"bootloadable":{},"ixData":{},"lid":"6378506347506725321"}

So Fancy Mammal was born, and continues to evolve as Brent and Kirsten continually trudge with their collaborative works back and forth between their respective homes in Southeast Portland.\n\nLight snacks and beverages will be provided.\nBring your family, your pets, and your friends - you don't want to miss this one!\n\n---\n\nArtists' Social Media:\nFancy Mammal: \ninstagram.com\/fancy_mammal\nfancymammal.etsy.com\n\nBrent:\nbrentwear.com\ninstagram.com\/brentwear\ntwitter.com\/brentwear\n\nKirsten\npiperewan.com\ninstagram.com\/piperewan\ntwitter.com\/piperewan"},{"id":1621397601500502,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.139.960.347\/s480x480\/15727383_10209151169996704_2684126936136234718_n.jpg?oh=d5bb0d61cd0b5434336fa230d22325f8&oe=58D665FB","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Hatch's Annual Anniversary Party!","day":"26","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Thu 6 PM","location":"HatchLabs\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"19 people interested","description":"Another smashing Hatch Innovation party is planned, and you\u2019re invited!!\n\nPlease join us the evening of Thursday, January 26th, to celebrate three important Hatch milestones \u2014 at another of our hand-crafted gatherings you\u2019ve come to love!\n\nIt\u2019s a triple celebration!\nTHREE years ago we opened HatchLabs, Portland\u2019s social entrepreneurship coworking space for innovators and doers!\nTWO years ago investing in Oregon businesses was made legal via Oregon\u2019s CPOs (aka Hatch Oregon Community Public Offerings - and, there may be a surprise reveal of more!)\nTHIS year we opened HatchLab Baker, in historic Baker City, Oregon!\n\nPLUS, hear about the future of the HatchOregon1000, our statewide small business fundraising campaign!\n\nThe gist: This is a private, friends and family event (with your plus-ones of course).

Divisive war memories lie at the root of the contentious politics surrounding Japan's pacifist constitution and remilitarization, and fuel the escalating frictions in East Asia known collectively as Japan's \"history problem.\" Drawing on ethnography, interviews, and a wealth of popular memory data, this lecture discusses three preoccupations - national belonging, healing, and justice - in Japan's discourses of defeat. The discussion focuses on key war memory narratives that are shaping Japan's choices - nationalism, pacifism, or reconciliation - for addressing the rising international tensions and finally overcoming its dark history."},{"id":162134510931438,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.73.480.173\/p320x320\/15590191_360966150926607_645843992448143370_n.jpg?oh=005bc49f878496a972610226335e3093&oe=5909DA01","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"2017 Key Leaders Forum","day":"26","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Thu 4 PM","location":"Sonrise Church\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Hillsboro","socialContext":"3 people going","description":"A dialogue between community leaders, housing experts and government to tackle the housing crisis, learning from successful initiatives and charting a course for Washington County.\n\nKeynote Address: Margaret Salazar, Director of Oregon Housing and Community Solutions.\n\nFireside Chat with: \nJes Larson, Director of Welcome Home Coalition\nIsrael Bayer, Executive Director of Street Roots\nRoss Cornelius, Client Services Manager at Walsh Construction Co. \nDan Valliere, Executive Director of  REACH Community Development \n\nSchedule:\n\n4 - 4:30 - Registration, Check-in and Networking\n4:30 - 5:30 - Program\n5:45 - 6:15  - Networking and light food\n\nEvent is FREE, but we politely ask that you register.\n\nFor more information and to register, please visit http:\/\/conta.cc\/2hIaswu"}],"paginationCursor":"eyJzdGFydF90aW1lIjoxNDg1NDE3NjAwLCJlbmRfdGltZSI6MTQ4NTUwMzk5OSwiYnJvd3NlX2N1cnNvciI6IkFiclBxTzg0b2J0QTF3YTB0UmdmZGJKU192M3NLaGNpb0pYWjdHYU5FdWl1TW1rb0xBeW9kNHlmSmJVUDBtRFIyUTMwVzJsTzYtckNrRkhTQ0lrb0o1aGI4T1hKVXdHTUc5QmdhcXN6c2w4SXdnaS1uWklOY2ZUaEJBMHJtbUxhdWlfaEZSQy1SZ21zYlNEb1MtU1B2X3lxbFVRT0NCM19BZTZweGlUX2VyV2FrQ25FWXc0VEp5Y0ItWE5SVVU5M2NoUjRPYmR0LWtKMDhoazBrR2xZZFNCLXMyS2cydzQxSzJZbmh3ZlpjRGFmdmlKd09RY2R5Z29lV3JVdndHU3ljTGRzam9weFczLXUtMXMzb0gwWlpjdnpjeHdJbHBySWh3dlhjWW9kWXhlUnN3In0=","hasNextPage":true}],"isGroupedList":false},"bootloadable":{},"ixData":{},"lid":"6378506401805893989"}

Tent cities often exemplify self-management, direct democracy, tolerance, mutual aid, and resourceful strategies for living with less. This book presents a vision for how cities can constructively build upon these positive dynamics rather than continuing to seek evictions and pay the high costs of policing homelessness.\n\nThe tiny house village provides a path forward to transitional and affordable housing within the grasp of a local community. It offers a bottom-up approach to the provision of shelter that is economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable\u2014both for the individual and the city. The concept was first pioneered by Portland's Dignity Village, and has since been re-imagined by Eugene's Opportunity Village and Olympia's Quixote Village. Now this innovative model has emerged from the Northwest to inspire projects in Madison, Austin, and Ithaca, and is being pursued by advocacy groups throughout the country.\n\nThis 252-page book compiles four years of research on the topic and includes 37 photographs, 16 illustrations, and 7 case studies. Along with documenting and articulating the roots of this budding movement, the book provides a practical guide to help catalyze new and existing initiatives in other areas.\n\nAndrew Heben is an urban planner, writer, and tiny house builder based in Eugene, Oregon. He has visited over a dozen tent cities and tiny house villages throughout the country, and spent time living in an unsanctioned, self governed tent city known as Camp Take Notice in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Heben has since helped co-found SquareOne Villages, a non-profit organization that puts many of the ideas within this book into action."},{"id":1175094092603149,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.0.300.172\/p200x200\/15871696_1335270866536877_7243109187779933887_n.jpg?oh=f651edc603c2c01dfab71316a2745a12&oe=5906733E","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c103.0.755.755\/s173x172\/12195984_892564420861701_6678337161897249648_n.jpg?oh=200b01ef5b43afb3f37a1a5ba1dba26d&oe=5918AB0C","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/1175094092603149\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Live at Lunch presents Cody Ray & The New Favorites","day":"26","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Thu 12 PM","location":"Smith Memorial Student Union\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"4 people going","description":"Live at Lunch presents\nCody Ray & The New Favorites\n12:00pm - 1:00pm\nFREE and all ages\n\nParkway North, Smith Memorial Student Union ROOM 101\n1825 SW Broadway,\nPortland, OR 97201\n\nCody Ray & The New Favorites - A Neo-Soul\/R&B, Funk-Rock fusion group, founded by singer-songwriter and guitar player, Cody Ray Raymond in the spring of 2015.

At the age of eight, he was drawn to the trumpet in a music appreciation class in his elementary school.\n\n\u201cI was very fortunate that I had that exposure to music and was encouraged to stick with it. Years ago, when the arts programs were cut out of our public schools, so many kids stopped having that kind of opportunity.\u201d\n\nA legendary trumpet player, Alpert\u2019s extraordinary musicianship has earned him five #1 hits, nine GRAMMY\u00ae Awards, the latest from his 2014 album, \u201cSteppin\u2019 Out,\u201d fifteen Gold albums, fourteen Platinum albums and has sold over 72 million records. Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass propelled his sound into the pop music limelight, at one point outselling the Beatles two to one. In 1966, they achieved the since-unmatched feat of simultaneously having four albums in the Top 10-- and five in the Top 20. Herb Alpert also has the distinction of being the only artist who has had a #1 instrumental and vocal single.\n\nSome of Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass\u2019 fourteen Top 40 singles include; The Lonely Bull, Mexican Shuffle, Spanish Flea and the GRAMMY\u00ae-winners \u201cA Taste Of Honey\u201d and \u201cWhat Now My Love,\u201d and the #1 hits \u201cThis Guy\u2019s In Love With You\u201d and \u201cRise.\u201d Shout! Factory recently released deluxe re-masters of the entire TJB catalogue plus Lost Treasures, a compilation of vintage rarities, and Rewhipped, featuring hot remixes of every track from Whipped Cream & Other Delights. In all, Alpert has recorded over thirty albums and produced for many other artists, including Sergio Mendes & Brasil \u201966, Stan Getz, Michel Colombier, Gato Barbieri, and Alpert\u2019s wife, GRAMMY winning vocalist Lani Hall, to name a few.\n\nAs an industry leader, Alpert\u2019s commitment to artists with personal vision guided A&M Records (with partner Jerry Moss) from a Hollywood garage operation into one of the most successful independent record labels in music history that started in 1962 with Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. Stars including Janet Jackson, Quincy Jones, Sergio Mendes & Brasil \u201966, Stan Getz, Cat Stevens, Supertramp, The Carpenters, Carole King, Sheryl Crow, Peter Frampton, The Police and scores of others that are evidence of the consistent quality and diversity of the A&M Records family.\n\nIn 2006, Alpert and Moss were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in recognition of their accomplishments and are a part of the Grammy Museum\u2019s \u201dIcons of the Music Industry\u201d series. In 2013 Herb Alpert was awarded The National Medal of Arts Award by President Barack Obama for his musical, philanthropic and artistic contributions.\n\nHerb Alpert has continually explored other artistic ventures, always acknowledging a connection between music and visual art in his creative process. A painter for over four decades, Alpert\u2019s bold, abstract expressionist canvases have been exhibited internationally and are a part of the permanent collections of MoCA Museum in L.A. and The Tennessee State Art Museum in Nashville and has been shown in galleries around the U.S. and Europe.\n\nA sculptor for over three decades Alpert has installed his lyrical sculpture and his massive, bronze Totem sculptures that have been on public display throughout Los Angles, New York City, Nashville Tennessee, and most recently Chicago.\n\nAlpert explains, \u201cThere is a certain satisfaction and energy that comes from playing the horn \u2013 a feeling that I am really in my element. I am passionate about what I am doing, whether painting, sculpting or playing the trumpet. I am just trying to create whatever comes out in the spontaneity of the moment.\u201d\n\nBroadway theatre is another arena in which Alpert has enjoyed success. His producing credits include the Tony Award\/Pulitzer Prize-winning production of Tony Kushner\u2019s Angels in America, Jelly\u2019s Last Jam, Arthur Miller\u2019s Broken Glass, August Wilson\u2019s Seven Guitars and The Boy from Oz.\n\nWith his desire to bring the arts back to young people, the Herb Alpert Foundation is helping to change the educational environment.\n\nThe Herb Alpert Foundation supports a number of educational, arts and compassion oriented programs, dedicated to serving young people to help them reach their potential and lead productive, fulfilling lives and to support their unique creative energies and special talents. HAF supports young people to live free from prejudice and, with its many programs, nurtures a capacity for empathy, compassion, mutual respect, tolerance and kindness.\n\nTo keep jazz alive, The Herb Alpert Foundation, which he oversees with his wife Lani Hall Alpert, has worked with the Theolonius Monk Institute at the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music. The UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music focuses on cross-cultural experimentation and musical diversity with an emphasis on music and influences from around the world. In an effort to prepare young musicians to succeed in a world far different than the one he knew starting out, the school is part of Alpert\u2019s vision of the transformative power of the creative experience.\n\nOver the past 20 years, 100 mid-career, risk-taking artists have received the Herb Alpert Award in the Arts in conjunction with Cal Arts, which also houses the Herb Alpert School of Music at Cal Arts.\n\nIn addition to his on-going creative outlets in music, philanthropy and the arts, Alpert owns the noted Vibrato restaurant\/jazz club in Bel-Air, California. He also continues to perform and tour across the country with his wife, Grammy-winning singer, Lani Hall.\n\nHis priorities derive from the same sense of generosity and humility that has guided him through a long, illustrious career. In all of these ventures, there is a harmony not unlike Alpert\u2019s music. A flowing of energy and sound, a dedication to quality, which sustains everything Alpert does. With more than 40 years of continuous philanthropic, musical and artistic activity, Alpert has established a legacy that reflects his firm belief that the arts can make a difference in the world and in the lives of each of us.\n\nLANI HALL \nGrammy Award-winning vocalist and producer, Lani Hall started her singing career in 1966, as the lead singer of Sergio Mendes\u2019s break through group, Brasil \u201966. She left behind her city roots in Chicago and, for 5 years, performed throughout the world. While Lani\u2019s singing career took her on the road, she also focused on her writing\u2014committing to the page her personal impressions of the world around her. Sergio Mendes further expanded her writing career by asking Lani to write the English lyrics for many of the band\u2019s Brazilian songs.\n\nIn 1966, A&M Records signed Brasil \u201966 and Lani met her future husband, music legend, Herb Alpert, who is also the co-founder of A&M Records. Herb and Lani married in 1973.\n\nLani has the distinction of recording more than 22 albums in three different languages (English, Portuguese and Spanish, and in 1983, she sang the title song for the James Bond film, Never Say Never Again. In 1986 Hall won with her first Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Performance for her album, Es Facil Amar. Hall picked up her second Grammy Award as producer on Herb Alpert\u2019s 2013 Grammy winning album, Steppin\u2019 Out. Since 2006, Hall and Alpert have been touring with their band to sell out performances.\n\nAfter establishing a successful solo career in music, and becoming a wife and mother, Lani began to explore new creative outlets for her writing. In the early 1980\u2019s, while singing in Mexico City, she started writing in short story form. Her writing process is similar to her singing process in so far as she can visually see a song\/lyric unfold before her, as if she were watching a movie.\n\nHer debut book, Emotional Memoirs & Short Stories, compiles 10 short stories from 30 years of writing short fiction and true stories from her life\u2014all woven together by a connecting personal narrative, with the city of Chicago as the backdrop. Her characters are intelligent, modern women struggling to navigate the uncertain waters of adultery, therapy, cosmetic surgery, postpartum depression and their own sexuality. Lou Adler describes Lani\u2019s book as \u201cfree-form as a jazz piece weaving in and out of intriguing situations and indelible characters. She writes as she sings, with emotion and passion.\u201d And now, with the release of her audio book, Emotional Memoirs & Short Stories, Hall has mixed her two creative expressions to make one total experience. With her emotional narration at the forefront, Lani has placed a unique, musically scored soundtrack, creating an emotional landscape of music, to all 10 stories, making each chosen scene come to vivid life.\n\nEmotional Memoirs & Short Stories gives us a rare glimpse at the double-edged sword that is the life of an artist."},{"id":392687374406281,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.147.640.231\/s480x480\/16002746_1413524998692022_4897180382156077020_n.jpg?oh=b27f6eba31060ba4873866c5ecb29aac&oe=59102048","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"1988 Red Burgundy Tasting","day":"26","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Thu 6:30 PM","location":"E&R WINE SHOP\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"","description":"THREE seats left\n\n1988 Red Burgundy\nTasting (all '88's)\n \nThursday, January 26\n6:30 PM\n\nHuber Ligner\nMorey-St-Denis 1er Cru\n\nChateau de La Tour\nClos Vougeot Grand Cru\n\nAlain Burguet\nGevrey-Chambertin Vielles Vignes\n\nLouis Jadot\nChambertin Clos de B\u00eaze Grand Cru\n\nA.F.

With only a couple of weeks left before the Trump administration is in place, it is CRUCIAL that we make the DAPL project financially unreasonable to complete. We are spending a day getting as many Portlanders as possible to take their money out of banks that fund DAPL. There will be cocoa, talking to strangers, and the merry jingle of the sounds of oil corporation bankruptcy. \n\nHere's the Plan: \nWe'll meet up at the Rising Tide office, go over the strategy and talking points and then at 2:30 we will leave to fan out to as many different banks that fund DAPL as possible. Armed with tastefully designed \"move your money\" info packets (provided at the office), we will stand outside the banks, or on busy intersections or parks, in pairs or small groups and ask folks to move their money to a credit union or local bank that doesn't fund environmental destruction and violate indigenous rights. The goal is to have as many personal conversations with folks as possible and leave with new friends! After banks close we'll meet at The Standard Bar (on 22nd & Burnside) for a tasty beverage and a debrief.\n\nCheck out the de-fund DAPL withdrawal tracker, over 43 million and counting! http:\/\/www.defunddapl.org\/defund\nLet's make this number skyrocket!\n\nCan't make it to the event? Download and share your own Move Your Money packet! https:\/\/portlandrisingtide.org\/move-money-packets\/\n\nWhat to Bring:\n-Warm clothes, snacks and water. \n-Anything else you need to be comfortable standing outside for a few hours.\n-A buddy if you've got one! \n-Treats to entice strangers to talk to you (optional) \n-A sign related to NODAPL (optional)\n-Musical instrument (optional)\n\nIf you can't join at 2pm, check back here and we will post places for people to join in throughout the afternoon."},{"id":777467825741309,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/l\/t1.0-9\/c0.184.464.168\/15941232_1400163386692377_2970431725129862582_n.png?oh=154e2a794722c0af18321304fc7c015c&oe=590887DE","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Family Movie Night","day":"26","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Thu 6 PM","location":"Dilley Elementary PTO\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Forest Grove","socialContext":"3 people going","description":"Wear your pj's, bring your blankets and enjoy a wonderful free, family movie together!

This Reflective Awareness Practice, as it is called, cultivates awareness and strengthens memory.  Intuition and sensitivity increase. We develop an inner wakefulness that can serve as a compass when working with others or simply living our lives. We will also learn mindfulness techniques and their uses for healing, stress reduction and pain management.  \n \nClass 2: Buddhism Comes to the West: Cutting Through Materialism\nOver the past two decades, interest in Buddhism and meditation has grown tremendously in the United States\u2014in 2003, Time magazine estimated that 10 million people meditate regularly.

Known for his smooth, clear voice and authentic phrasing, Jonathan \u201cJT\u201d Trawick continues a rich tradition of singing from deep within the Ozark hills. Just as well versed in western swing as bluegrass and folk, JT has a story for just about everybody. As an in-demand rhythm guitarist at fiddle contests across the United States, Jonathan met Aarun and backed her when she won her Young Adult National Fiddle Championship title. Already a heavily decorated fiddler, Aarun made an early mark in the fiddle contest world claiming 5 Colorado State Fiddle Championships, Arkansas State Traditional Champion and Top 10 at the Grand Master Fiddle Championships. Just this year, Aarun was crowned 2016 Oregon State Fiddle Champion, 2016 Spirit of the West Champion and finished Top 10 in the Grand National Fiddle Championships and Top 5 in the Grand National Swing Championships.  In 2013, Aarun & Jonathan were hand-picked to record Volume 1 of the Deep End Sessions, a widely acclaimed project lauded by both the Los Angeles Times and The Huffington Post. Volume 1 was released in May 2014 and voted a Top 5 Album of the year by Northwest Music Scene. In October 2015, Aarun & Jonathan released Ida Red, a cover of the Bob Wills classic with their western swing dance band, Well Swung. The recording was voted Top 5 in the Western Swing Song category by the Academy of Western Artists. Quickly becoming known for their tight harmonies and expert performances of classics, Aarun & Jonathan carry the flame of authenticity into the future.\n\nCome down and see Ms. Aarun Carter and Jonathan Trawick at the Colony Pub This Acoustic Thursday!

The play tells the story of citizens in an unnamed country that is recovering from the after-effects of a violent dictatorship.\n\nSet in a country that is transitioning to democracy, Death and the Maiden explores how -- and if -- a nation can start to heal its wounds after years of living in a dictatorship regime. Gerardo and Paulina are married, and have finally started to relax after years of living in fear. Gerardo, a lawyer, has just accepted a post as the head of a citizenship committee that will investigate the past crimes of the dictatorship. Unfortunately, the committee will not be able to publicly name the criminals, and no one will be prosecuted, as a result. Gerardo feels that the committee will be a way for the country to peacefully transition to the new government, but his wife Paulina has other ideas of justice. Paulina is traumatized by her past: she was kidnapped, tortured, and raped by members of the former regime.  Determined to administer justice for herself, she takes matters into her own hands and makes sure her torturer pays for his former sins.  Death and the Maiden is a political and moral thriller that examines the psychological aftereffects of human rights abuses.\n\nThis play contains adult themes and language and is not suitable for younger audiences.  Please note a firearm will be discharged during the performance.\n\n$15 in our McTavish Room.  Tickets available on TicketsWest or in our Box Office, Wed-Sat 2-5:30pm."}],"paginationCursor":"eyJzdGFydF90aW1lIjoxNDg1NDE3NjAwLCJlbmRfdGltZSI6MTQ4NTUwMzk5OSwiYnJvd3NlX2N1cnNvciI6IkFicXlUcGE0TmoxSURKZjNkM25xMG9yd2Mtck5CdW1IeFRQcUZqMGFYa1VBU3JWVzhCcWhnYzBlSmlJY0JWWWpFckpqcFlWYUdjcnd1b2J6YkZVSHBqUkpvMlc4SXJQd2tGN2gyRlBQUXRFNnV1LWJ0V1VCc2l2ZFdyWF9kbUNnZTNSbHZjbHVIU1oycGdjc3o0UWRUUV9ZendzakRjNnozZlhkaXdtem5tb2Vjdk5uaVA3VXVHTUQ4UHk5cjNiS0NCekx5T3FQNGxiX01QLXJIYmRVdVVvRXZEbThCZ1BmSllKWUNkVjdldmNlU3dsWjZ1SlctVkFONTJNV2I3MGtrN1o2U25QcHREb3BzRk1uUWZybmQ1dmw2M0xCQktnYzRUeVdzd3djbmFESGNnIn0=","hasNextPage":true}],"isGroupedList":false},"bootloadable":{},"ixData":{},"lid":"6378506991190891978"}

Graveyard of the Pacific is a full bodied Imperial Red bursting with aroma and flavor from a hardy dose of Amarillo, Galaxy, Columbus, and Simcoe hops. With Citrus in the forefront followed by  a hint of passion fruit and floral and just a touch of earthiness this beer will not disappoint. It's well balanced with a nice mouth feel and color coming from the Crystal, Honey, and Chocolate malts.\n\nEven at 10\u0025 ABV and 100 IBU, Graveyard of the Pacific is a big beer that is smooth and very drinkable. The final product was improved by the killer artwork done by artist Kyle Shold, which will grace the label of the bottle. Kyle captured the feel of the stretch of water from Tillamook Bay, past the treacherous Columbia River Bar to the tip of Vancouver Island that has claimed over 2,000 vessels & more than 700 lives. This unforgiving combination of current, fog, storms, waves, and rocks has long been known by one name: The Graveyard of the Pacific. \n\nGraveyard of the Pacific will be available for a limited time at select bottle shops around Southwest Washington and coastal locations as well as on draft at Feral Public House and Heathen Brewing in Vancouver, WA and North Jetty Brewing in Seaview, WA. Release parties are scheduled over the following two days: January 25th at Heathen's Feral Public House located at 1109 Washington St in Vancouver, WA from 6:00pm-8:00pm and January 26th at North Jetty Brewing located at 4200 Pacific Way in Seaview WA from 5:00pm-9:00pm. Check location Facebook pages for events and updates. So grab a bottle or a pint and have a drink in honor of the men and women who make their living on the waves of the Graveyard of the Pacific!\n\nTrivia starts at 6:30 so be sure to stick around for a fun night!"},{"id":1702258046733049,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.171.694.251\/s480x480\/16142754_1559761547372446_2054111254520287487_n.jpg?oh=190cfcd4bf91363797d1e39c1fec4562&oe=5915C5C0","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"United Way Partnership Night at Burgerville!","day":"26","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Thu 5 PM","location":"Burgerville - Centralia\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Centralia, WA","socialContext":"23 people interested","description":"Join United Way of Lewis County for another partnership night at Burgerville in Centralia. 10\u0025 of all proceeds from 5-8pm will be donated to United Way - drive thru and dine in!"},{"id":305932913138037,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t31.0-0\/c0.44.480.173\/p480x480\/16107510_10154108320576044_50008906031901344_o.jpg?oh=53d86f2e185e451a7ad5f2d103d11699&oe=5921F066","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Treat Yourself Thursdays: A Self Care Event","day":"26","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Thu 12 PM","location":"Oregon State Women's Center\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Corvallis","socialContext":"9 people interested","description":"Everyone deserves a treat!
