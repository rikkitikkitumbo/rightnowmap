We have worked with them on our other two videos and are excited to have them on board. \n\nDETAILS:\n\nOur vision for this video is to display real people and families. The song is about the traumas and victories that tie us together. The experiences that ultimately identify who we are or who we're trying to be. \n\nWe will have an 8x10 piece of paper in many colors that says #whatmakesmehuman printed on the bottom. We want to display a vulnerability and authenticity to this song describing YOU! Examples are: \n\n\" I'm learning to accept who I am.\" \n\" I'm becoming more .....\"\n\" I'm not afraid.....\" \n\nTheses are examples to think about what makes you human, what makes you unique, what your triumph is or what your past has brought you too. What has influenced you that helps you identify your humanity. \n\nWe are looking for at least 50 people to show up between 12 and 5. Bring your family and invite your friend. What we are filming is you holding up your paper to the camera, maybe you're smiling, maybe you're laughing, maybe your frowning. We want you to come just as you are, no special clothing, - just be you. After we get some B roll and your shot you will then hang your paper on the wall which will spell out Human. We need our COMMUNITY!!

We select one \nlocal person, family or cause to support with all proceeds.  This year Journey has selected Bree Ellison as our Sportsman Banquet Recipient for 2017.\n\n\tBen Wohl and Bree Ellison were camping at Winchester Bay \nLabor Day Weekend last year. They decided to go for a 4-wheeler ride on the dunes, and around 11 pm on September 2nd, Ben and Bree who were riding double, were struck by a Polaris Razor. Ben\u2019s cousin and husband found Ben and Bree laying in the sand, with two men and a woman standing over them, and then the Razor\u2019s occupants ran away into the woods. Ben passed away there at the scene. Bree was taken to the \nhospital in Reedsport and then transferred to River Bend in Eugene. \nShe sustained a broken leg, broken ribs, bruised spine, facial\/jaw \nfracture(s), and a traumatic brain injury. She currently is still healing and waiting to see the full extent of nerve damage and neurological \ndeficiencies that she may face. While dealing with all the physical injuries that she has suffered, she is also going through the loss of her boyfriend, Ben. Bree has a five year old daughter, Brooklyn, and works for the \nOregon Judicial Department. \n\n\tHer recovery is an ongoing process and we need your help. Not only for any monetary means we can generate, but also for a showing of love and support for Bree and to show her that she is not alone. We ask you to also join us the following Sunday morning, Jan. 29th during our church service when we will present Bree with the proceeds from the event and pray together for her.\n\nWe Hope to see you there!"},{"id":1831917617096627,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.220.960.347\/s480x480\/15940418_1381255938573630_4373818341022648161_n.jpg?oh=90ff1613af7d04879571945d76db1717&oe=5921404F","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Bluebird Hill Wine Tasting at Market of Choice","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 2 PM","location":"Market of Choice\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Eugene","socialContext":"7 people interested","description":"Sue will be pouring Bluebird Hill wines at Market of Choice\/Delta Oaks from 2 to 5 pm January 28, 2017."},{"id":1230612410307719,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.274.480.173\/p480x480\/15977614_373543842999887_602902651927656108_n.jpg?oh=6899c3b1468abc1606e1d9e946ccfcb3&oe=58FEE248","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Headbangerz 101 Rave! 21+","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 10 PM","location":"Flippin 50's Diner & Lounge\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Elma, WA","socialContext":"6 people interested","description":"Come see me throw the fatest Headbangerz dubstep! \nFree! 21+ all night!"},{"id":252087901860994,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.6.784.283\/s480x480\/14956528_372567433085520_4387327185388998780_n.jpg?oh=157e7cb4bfe438b6708303b44c701523&oe=59017B14","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Intimacy in Pregnancy & Postpartum","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 6:30 PM","location":"First Alternative Natural Foods Co-op\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Corvallis","socialContext":"15 people interested","description":"Join the MidValley Birth Network for an informative evening of food, fun and fashion including 50 gift bags given out with cards, coupons and samples!\n\n*Discussion on Pelvic Floor Health and Intimacy during Pregnancy and Postpartum, led by Kerry Boysen from Restore Physical Therapy.\n\n*Fashion show featuring local moms and their comfy, yet fashionable, pregnancy and breastfeeding attire - LuLaRoe by Sara Thomson.\n\nWomen only, lap babies only, please.\n\n$10 for Non MidValley Birth Network Members\n$5 for Members\n\nRestore Physical Therapy\nLularoe Sara Thomson"},{"id":1752054841788774,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/q87\/c0.26.960.347\/s480x480\/16105545_642847202554489_1953537000685502222_n.jpg?oh=b32fb935dfc4edd3e6e599f9b9c5c22d&oe=58FF17D3","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"SINK Premiere!","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 6 PM","location":"Kenneth J.

We will be making rooster art  WITHOUT the use of feathers, for this very reason as well as wishing to keep RANGA house green and cruelty-free. Participants may draw, collage, or paint images of feathers to their hearts content, but no actual bird feathers will be used.  Play with mixed media, paper craft, hot glue, and sequins to complete the rooster of your dreams! All supplies are provided to creatively express, however you may bring magazines, paper, or tools from home that you'd like to use for a personal touch.\nHOSTED BY: Nickhole Arcade, RANGA, One Tiny Firework\n\n Translation: It's FREE and you can totally get paint on the floor!

In the early 1990's the trio did remixes for Cypress Hill, and Naughty By Nature among many others. Thier original goal was to just make beats. This earned them a contract to call their own with Combat Redords. Thier first album came out in 1993 and was entitled, \"Intoxicated Demons\". This was a short LP containing 10 tracks. Fashion was jailed for 6 months soon after the albums release for drug charges, and after his release left the Beatnuts and went solo releasing his own album. Soon afterwards Les and Ju released another album this time self-entitled with Violator\/Relativity Records. In 1997 the smash hit single \"Off Tha Books\" was released on the album, \"Stone Crazy\". \"The Spot Remix\" was released next with remixes of several of thier popular tracks, along with a new track.\n\n In 1999 The Beatnuts released the hit album, \"A Musical Massacre\". Thier latest album \"Take It or Squeeze It\"was released last year in 2001, leaving Beatnuts fans hungry for more. The Beatnuts released the album entitled \"The Originators\" on October 22nd 2002, released on Landspeed-Records. The Nuts currently have left Landspeed and on Penalty Recordings having released their lastest album \"Milk Me\".An underground Latino crew who moved from being strictly producers to make some action on the other side of the mixing board as well, the Beatnuts first hooked up in the late '80s, with Junkyard Ju-Ju (aka JuJu, born Jerry Tineo) and Psycho Les (born Lester Fernandez) being joined by Fashion (aka Kool Fashion, born Berntony Smalls). After working with the Jungle Brothers, the trio connected with Monie Love on a production job for \"Pups Lickin Bone\" from her 1990 debut album, Down to Earth. They also worked on remixes for Cypress Hill, Naughty by Nature, da Lench Mob, and Prime Minister Pete Nice, earning their own contract with Combat Records for the 1993 mini-LP Intoxicated Demons. The album's release was held up when Kool Fashion was arrested and jailed for six months on a drug conviction, but the Beatnuts released a self-titled album the following year, on Violator\/Relativity. \n\nAfter a hiatus verging on three years, Fashion became a Muslim and left the Beatnuts, releasing his debut solo album, God Connections, with production help from his old bandmates. JuJu and Psycho Les finally returned to release the Beatnuts' third album, Stone Crazy, in 1997. Musical Massacre followed two years later. Take It or Squeeze It, issued in spring 2001, captured the Beatnuts' danceable funk as well as collaborations with Method Man and Fat Man Scoop. The next year, The Originators brought back Al Tariq (that is, Kool Fashion) and delivered another round of bionic beats."},{"id":127729097704000,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t31.0-0\/c0.138.480.173\/p480x480\/15167680_1270907662971631_783685740530510931_o.jpg?oh=ec81e3b7d151698aecea65faedacf933&oe=5915DF87","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Sakrificer, Cemetery Lust and Raptor","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 8:30 PM","location":"Twilight Cafe and Bar\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"133 people interested","description":"Action movie night and Famine Fest presents..... \n\nSakrificer (Los Angeles based thrashers, first time to portland since Famine Fest 22016) -https:\/\/youtu.be\/VidePfxtmVY\n\nCemetery Lust -https:\/\/youtu.be\/eqfSTSa538I\n\nRaptor-https:\/\/youtu.be\/19q8pbJg-kg\n\nDj Old Man Stares and Dj Wes Craven\n\nDoors at 830, $10\/$13 cover, no minors."},{"id":1727850284197556,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.99.960.347\/s480x480\/15697938_1276408775735769_7686382699394494478_n.jpg?oh=d6d98cd7ec7d8e6db023f72e40ccf04d&oe=5917CD1F","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"New Moon Mandarin Release Party and Chinese New Year Celebration","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 4 PM","location":"Reverend Nat's Hard Cider\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"228 people interested","description":"Celebrate Chinese New Year and the 2017 release of New Moon Mandarin!\n\n\"Channeling the best champagne mimosas was my goal with this spring seasonal.

The words \"Soulful,\" \"Eclectic,\" \"Seductive,\" and more, have all been used to attempt to describe the Portland-born artist but none of those words come close; she is all of those things and much, much more. The showcase has been specifically designed to demonstrate the artist's unparalleled versatility, with a first set comprised of Soul\/R&B songs, during which she will be accompanied by Seattle natives Gerald and Thaddeus Turner, Darrius Willrich, and Maurice Bailey. Those who follow the NW music scene will undoubtedly recognize those names; three of them (the Turner brothers and Darrius Willrich) are currently touring Europe as the band for legendary 90\u2019s Hip-Hop group, \"Digable Planets.\u201d The fourth member of this outstanding band accompanying Ms. Ivancie is drummer Maurice Bailey, who has played with some of the most legendary names in the history of popular music, including such luminaries as George Benson, Kenny G, Stevie Nicks, Crosby-Stills and Nash, Jeffery Osborn, Franky Beverly & Maze, and the list goes on. \n\nIvancie will then follow that first set with an all-acoustic set, where the audience will be treated to the unique genius of the songwriting and haunting vocal talents that allowed her to open for the likes of David Ryan Harris, Ladi6, and The Indigo Girls (even though, at that time, she had barely scratched the surface of her capabilities). She will be joined in this set by the legendary cellist, Skip Vonkuske, one of the founding members of The Portland Cello Project, who has created numerous film and web soundtracks and currently performing under the name \u201cCellotronik.\u201d She will also be joined on this set by standup bass player extraordinaire Julio Appling, who has served as the upright bassist for the jamgrass ensemble The Student Loan Stringband for over a decade as well as being a member of the jazz fusion group Trio Flux. \n\nLast, but certainly not least, there will be a third and final set of songs that would fall into the Soul\/Rock category. Laura will be joined in this set by some of the best musicians Portland has ever produced, including Oregon Hall of Fame guitarist Jay \"Bird\" Koder; bass player Gary Fountaine of Portland Icon NU SHOOZ fame; Ramsey Embick, whose keyboard accomplishments are too numerous to mention, spanning a career that includes being the keyboard player and musical director for 70\u2019s\/80\u2019s super-group The Pointer Sisters, and finally Tyrone Hendrix, who is widely regarded as one of the best drummers in the NW. Also joining us for a special guest appearance on this set will be recent Oregon Music Hall of Fame nominee drummer Rusty Cox, whose lengthy credits include playing with the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s supergroup The Dazz Band, as well as over the past two decades serving as the drummer for Portland Soul singing sensation and Oregon Music Hall of Famer, Andy Stokes. Although she will mix in a few covers, in tribute to artists who have been an inspiration in her life, the evening will mostly be comprised of Laura Ivancie originals; written and arranged by Ivancie herself. \n\nSpecial guest DJ, world renowned SlimKid3, who first introduced himself to the world as an MC and founding member of the legendary hip-hop quartet The Pharcyde, will close out the evening, DJing from 11pm until... So come join the party and see for yourself what all the fuss is about... those of you who do will not soon forget it!"},{"id":1834830193431086,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.0.313.179\/p240x240\/16195493_1636942282999181_2858379173923125503_n.jpg?oh=8fc4ed229d2660865d2661efc7793238&oe=5923D49D","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c50.162.429.429\/s173x172\/12107731_10205328845888266_4212158363597101694_n.jpg?oh=25c9fd36ea797eeb60ef3448d3e1e750&oe=5908E4BE","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/1834830193431086\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"ANDAZ Bhangra Bollywood Dance Party: Anjali & The Incredible Kid","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 9 PM","location":"Analog Cafe & Theater\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"184 people interested","description":"ANDAZ \n\nwith your hosts and resident DJs Anjali & The Incredible Kid.\n\nSaturday, January 28th, 2016\n\nA Bhangra\/Bollywood\/Desi Bass Dance Party\n\nwith special guest percussionist Adam McCollom (Seattle) on the Panjabi dhol drum.\n\nAnjali and The Incredible Kid won Best DJ in Willamette Week's Best of Portland 2016 Readers' Poll and the Portland Mercury visited ANDAZ a few months ago and said, \"last month's was WILD.

They host the longest-running Bhangra and Bollywood party on the West Coast, co-founded the Pacific Northwest\u2019s first Global Bass dance party and host two weekly radio shows on XRAY.FM and KBOO.FM. Few DJs can be said to have changed the sound of their city but that is exactly what DJ Anjali and The Incredible Kid have accomplished since they first introduced Portland, Oregon nightclub audiences to the many varied sounds of Global Bass at a raucous New Year\u2019s Eve debut in 2000. They are most known for incinerating dance floors with the heavy dance floor artillery of South Asia, but the duo scour the globe for any hard-hitting music that combines local music traditions with window-rattling production. Anjali and The Kid regularly perform at festivals including five sets at the Sasquatch! Music Festival tenth anniversary where they headlined the dance tent opening night. They have performed at festivals such as Decibel, MusicfestNW, Vancouver International Bhangra Celebration, Beloved, Photosynthesis, Soul\u2019d Out, Portland International Film Festival, Fairytale Music Festival, Kaleidoscope and the Vancouver Queer Film Festival. The duo travel to perform in cities such as New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, San Francisco and Vancouver, BC to headline parties such as Basement Bhangra, iBomba, Bhangrateque, Ottomania and Non Stop Bhangra.\n\n     After making a name for themselves in their hometown\u2019s raucous house party circuit, DJ Anjali & The Incredible Kid introduced the Portland, Oregon nightclub scene to the sounds of Bhangra, Bollywood and Global Bass on New Year\u2019s Eve 2000. A series of residencies followed, beginning with a night at the legendary Blackbird, and the duo began hosting their ANDAZ dance parties in July of 2002. The party\u2019s focus on hardcore Panjabi Bhangra and the latest electronic confections from the Bollywood film industry continue to pack the dance floor after 12 years.

By 1981 he was regularly crossing the border into Northern Ireland to rifle through music stores for the things he liked, from post punk to synthpop to Shalamar.  The next 5 years saw him begin his obsession with collecting records; he started Djing in 1986 and caught the house music bug in the fall of that year. He took off to London to work in the spring of 1987 and immersed himself in a wide range of beat-driven music, from hip-hop to garage, to acid house and Detroit techno.\n\nOrr DJed in Ireland all through the late \u201880s and into the \u201890s before heading to San Francisco in 1995. From the mid-to-late \u201890s he wrote and edited for XLR8R, URB, Mixmag, Revolution and other electronic music publications.  As well as working for magazines he has written liner notes and promotional sheets for projects as diverse as Guidance Recordings\u2019 first compilation, Hi-Fidelity House Imprint One, the Confuzed Disco compilation on Italian label DFC and Sony Japan\u2019s Appleseed soundtrack, which featured tracks by Akufen, Basement Jaxx and Ryuichi Sakamoto.\n\nHis preferred style of DJing is an upfront mix of deep house, garage and melodic techno \u2014 inspired by the eclectic mixes he heard coming out of London and Manchester in the late \u201980s \u2014 but he can bust out the classics when necessary. He has performed opening or closing sets for Jovonn, Four Tet, Ceephax Acid Crew, David Holmes, Carl Craig, Pal Joey, Charles Webster, Z-Trip, DJ Harvey, Seiji, Shortkut, Daz i-Kue, Joey Negro, Simian Mobile Disco, 16B, Peanut Butter Wolf, SBTRKT, DJ Godfather, Larry Heard, Simon DK and Juan Atkins. He has also played support to artists such as, Buzzcocks, The Wedding Present, Innerzone Orchestra, The Rapture and Mobb Deep.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLOCAL UNDERGROUND HERO\"S\n\nOrographic - ( Bridge Club, Always Never Yesterday.

They use their grass-roots to readily tap into other genres such as folk, funk, rock, and hip hop.  Their music generates emotion and sends a message to a wide range of listeners, giving them an eclectic group of followers from all walks of life.  Useful Jenkins thrives on energy; they flourish in the moment and have an unmatched resonance with the crowd.  The band is made up of 2 acoustic guitars (lead and rhythm), violin, cello, bass and mandolin.  4-part vocal harmonies accompany the wall of stringed instruments, leaving listeners with a strong, clean, and unique sound. \n\nFormed as a 5 piece band in 2007, Useful Jenkins remained under-the-radar during their first few years performing.  Open mics and campfire jams were their source of inspiration, which allowed them to form a strong and intimate bond between band members and fans alike.  As their message grew, so did the network of friends who supported their direction.  In February of 2009, the band released their first full-length album \u201cFast Eddie\u201d which was the catalyst for their initial and continued success in the Midwest Festival Scene.  Their second album, \u201cFestival Express,\u201d was released in September of 2012.  It provided a more dynamic sound by capturing the raw bluegrass elements from the first album, and combining them with bowed string and brass instrumentation. In April of 2015 Useful Jenkins released their third full-length album, \u201cForward Motion,\u201d which was a statement of how the band continues to move and grow.\n\nThe best way to experience Useful Jenkins is live in concert.  Whether you are barefoot at a festival or standing in a theatre you will undoubtedly feel the pulse of their music, and leave the show with a smile on your face.  Their songs are memorable and easy to relate to, leaving them stuck in your head long after the performance.  So if you are a sucker for acoustic music with a strong message, do yourself a favor and go see a Useful Jenkins show.  It\u2019s a moment you will not soon forget.\n\n******CASCADE CRESCENDO******\nCascade Crescendo, from Portland, Oregon has been crafting their own brand of bluegrass since 2013. Pulling from their vast range of collective influences, they play original, high-energy bluegrass, jamgrass, and Americana music with captivating lead vocals by Hunter White, blazing fast mandolin licks by Aden Beck, and creative, thumping bass lines by Taylor Skiles. Duluth, MN banjo player, Harrison Olk (formerly of Tin Can Gin) joined the band in late 2015, bringing with him solid Scruggs-style banjo sounds and high lonesome harmony vocals.\n\nCascade Crescendo recorded their first studio album in Spring 2016 at The Hallowed Halls in Portland, OR. The album features fiddle player, Allie Kral (Yonder Mountain String Band) on five tracks and a guest appearance by drummer Nick Werth (Yak Attack, Ghost-Note). Cascade Crescendo is gaining steam in 2016, quickly winning over fans across the Pacific Northwest and beyond. They were on the lineup for the 2016 Northwest String Summit and are touring on the West Coast this fall and winter.\n\nCascade Crescendo has... \"gained a loyal following with their tightly crafted bluegrass that embraces tradition alongside more progressive, jam-oriented styles.\" - Glide Magazine \n\nhttp:\/\/www.glidemagazine.com\/164864\/video-premiere-portland-bluegrass-band-cascade-crescendo-team-allie-kral-side"}],"paginationCursor":"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","hasNextPage":true}],"isGroupedList":false},"bootloadable":{},"ixData":{},"lid":"6378513142396766551"}

Bar access with valid photo ID\n\nABOUT WITHIN SIGHT\u2013\n\nWithin Sight was founded in the winter of 2011 by guitarists Steven Carlson and Grant Evans. In November of 2013, after trying out many musicians to fill the positions they needed, Within Sight found its third guitarist\/soloist Sean Searls. Shortly after, they found the youngest member of the band, their drummer Sean Trenda only 19 years old. Jeremy Jordan (vocalist) and Jimmy Sandvig (Bassist) were a package deal and contacted the band from an online ad. Once Jeremy and Jimmy heard the bands instrumental demo, they were sold. After one try-out, they were the last two members to complete the lineup of Within Sight.\n\nIn May of 2014, Within Sight released a three track demo to promote the album \u201cThe Distance Traveled\u201d that is scheduled to be released in January of next year. The album has a huge variety of influences from all its band members. This is what makes Within Sight unique from most metal today. Steven has studied Bullet For My Valentine and Trivium shaping him into the guitarist he is today. Sean (Shredder) has a huge Metallica influence and can bring any song to life with a shredding solo. Grant brings pop punk into the mix with an A Day To Remember influence. Trenda (G baby or better known as Gerber because he is so small compared to the rest of the band) has studied the unforgettable Rev from Avenged Sevenfold since he started playing drums in 2007. Primus is the best way to describe Jimmy, his personality and talent reflects what he listens to. Jeremy was born to be a front man. Previously a drummer\/ lead vocalist of his last band and studying Killswitch Engage, Jeremy took his talent to the next level focusing on his vocals.\n\nWithin Sight has been gaining some ground considering half of the members have never been in bands or played a live show before, this band has come a long way from their first performance at the Hawthorn Theater on March 2nd in Portland OR. Now, booked through the end of the year Within Sight is scheduled to play a total of 16 shows. On top of all the self promoting and acquiring merchandise, recording has been a huge effort between shows. Also along with their album The Distance Traveled, Within Sight has been working on a music video that will be released with the album. All of Within Sights events and efforts are supported evenly by each member and could not happen without all of them. The band is projected to take the west coast by storm with a small west coast tour in the summer and at least triple the amount of shows played next year. \u201cThere is never a show not worth playing\u201d Jeremy says, \u201cA couple people or a couple hundred people, we will always put on a show and continue to do what we love\u201d.\n\nABOUT AGAINST THE RAGING TIDE\u2013\n\nAgainst the Raging Tide is a Rock\/ Metal band from the Oregon Coast, formed in 2013. ATRT has built a strong following, performing on many stages around the Pacific Northwest. With a sound and style derived from a vast array of influences, the band has utilized those musical backgrounds to weave together a supercharged, entertaining set list of groove rock and roll, and solid, face melting Heavy Metal. Against The Raging Tide has had the honor of sharing the stage with many talented local acts, as well as supporting well known national acts, such as: Local H, Demon Hunter, He Is Legend, CiG (Chad Ginsburg CKY), Trivium, Wilson, After The Burial, The Faceless, Rings of Saturn, Toothgrinder, Motograter, American Head Charge, Tantric, Saving Abel, Alien Ant Farm, William Control, and Trapt.

Their unique heavy-rock sound has been referred to the likes of Seether, Breaking Benjamin and Alter Bridge. Set in Stone offers a wide-range of styles and music diversity, which is the foundation of their unmistakably unique and all-original sound. Their deep guitar crunches, solid riffs, ground pounding bass, heavy-handed rhythmic drums and mesmerizing vocals are all reasons Set in Stone has quickly attracted the attention from all over the Pacific Northwest and beyond.\n\nSet in Stone released their first self-titled album in April 2009. Their first professional album \u2018Open Doors\u2019 debuted in May 2011. The album consists of 11 professionally recorded, mixed and mastered tracks recorded by Black Diamond Studios in Portland.

Others have described it as \"Anamism Americana\" - music that is infused with a deep connection to the natural world. Kaeley is inspired by the experiences of life and a belief that nature can be a connection and inspiration for us all.  \n\n Kaeley recently finished \"Paradise,\" her debut album, produced by longtime friend Scott Fisher (accomplished recording artist and LA producer). The album takes the listener on a melodic journey that stays true to the spirit and deep feeling of the songs. Kaeley's gentle, resonant voice and acoustic guitar is complemented by talented Portland artists making it an album of amazing musicianship and heart. \n\nThe contributors include Bob Dunham, Rob Stroup and Zane Carney on guitars, Matt Voth on electric bass, Will Amend on upright bass, Scott Fisher on keyboards, Paul Brainard on pedal steel and dobro, Kathryn Claire on fiddle, Tim Connell on mandolin, Skip VonKuske on cello, and Kaeley's sister - Heather McStay - on harmony vocals. \n\nKaeley's music is influenced by her diverse life experiences: From living in Ireland for a few years, to a passion for opera as a child, to singing formal choral works in high school and college. Growing up, her musical interests ranged from John Denver to the Andrew Sisters - and when everyone else was listening to Michael Jackson, Kaeley was discovering the EverIy Brothers.  She is drawn to folk icons such as Emmy Lou Harris and Bonnie Raitt and inspired by artists such as Brandi Carlile and Gillian Welch.     \n\nEarly in her career she taught environmental education and lived on Washington State's Olympic Peninsula, there Kaeley discovered the guitar as a way to accompany herself singing for friends and children. She always enjoyed playing for her own musical pleasure, but did not start to write songs to be shared until attending her first Puget Sound Workshop where she took her first songwriting class and was lost to that process. It was so satisfying to combine her own melodies and her own thoughts as one song led to the next. \n\nKaeley feels lucky to have been born and raised in Portland, OR, where, after some years away, she now resides with her husband and three daughters. She is a teacher with Music Together of Portland, a program whose mission is to help young children and their caregivers explore and play with music. She relishes the work of developing a musical foundation for children that can be carried throughout their lives. Over the past few years Kaeley has turned her attention to her own music and enjoys the process of sharing her songs with audiences. Kaeley says \"I write what feels good to sing and expresses feeling for me. I hope my songs elicit emotion for you and makes you want to sing along with me\"."},{"id":640102829495049,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.43.960.347\/s480x480\/15542320_1419499004762239_8194100382579930010_n.jpg?oh=447ff4cc6ba856e74c90f4bc4215271c&oe=59109C11","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Dynasty a Go-Go!","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 10 PM","location":"Killingsworth Dynasty\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"82 people interested","description":"Dynasty a Go-Go!

How can painting celebrate that?\n\nSince mid-2014, I have been working on several large, highly detailed paintings designed to be hung from the Ford Gallery\u2019s ceiling. Each picture depicts one live model who moved between two poses in the studio\u2014back and forth for months\u2014while I constantly changed my point of view and measured every body part and prop, painting them at exactly life size. I call these canvases documentary motion pictures, and I\u2019ll present them in a way that invites the audience to move, too. We\u2019ll hang the paintings in the middle of the gallery at various angles, using the paintings a bit like shoji, Japanese paper room dividers. To see the full show, viewers will have to move around the paintings\u2019 corners, encountering their material qualities, their heavy wood frames, copper nails and the shadow figures on semi-opaque stretched canvas\u2014a focus on the craftsmanship that makes the image possible.\n\nFor the exhibit\u2019s opening, I have invited performing artists Rachel Mann Band and Free Thought Takeover to perform an experiment. On January 28, these two Portland bands will each stage a musical set from inside the installation. The paintings will wall off each performer in his or her own little space, and I look forward to seeing how they choose to play with that problem. In the same way that revealing the backs of the paintings is an invitation to explore craftsmanship itself, I expect breaking up the band spatially might become a powerful way to reveal the band. With choreography and improvisation around and through the installation, Rachel Mann\u2019s dulcet harmonies will set up Free Thought Takeover\u2019s dance-inducing brass funk. To see the performance, the audience will be invited to move around in it, too.\n\nUsing the motions people are always doing anyway, we aim to shake up the viewing and listening habits that otherwise go unnoticed on a night out.\n\n\u2014 Paul Rutz\n\n \n\nAbout the artist\nPaul X. Rutz received his Ph.D. in Theory and Cultural Studies from Purdue University in 2011 after writing a dissertation on combat art and the Iraq war. That year Rutz took his portrait painting practice to Portland, OR, where he works with live models to develop life-size oil paintings. His work has been featured on the TV show Portlandia, and recent exhibitions include solo shows at Gay Street Gallery, Washington, VA, and Jupiter Gallery, as well as group shows at Mark Woolley Gallery and the Smithsonian Institution. His series of dual-media portraits of combat veterans, titled Between Here and There, has traveled to galleries in Portland, Vashon Island, WA, and the Oregon Military Museum. Rutz also writes about visual culture, with recent publications in the Huffington Post, On Patrol, Military History Magazine and many others.\n\nwww.paulrutz.com\n\nPaul X. Rutz - Portrait Painter\n \n\nAbout The Performers\nRachel Mann Band\n\nPortland based singer-songwriter brings a special blend of old-time, country and folk.\n\nwww.rachelmannmusic.com \n\nFree Thought Takeover has been taking over Portland since March 2015. This lineup is stacked with professional musicians from across the country (New York, Chicago, Honolulu, Boston, Miami) bringing Portland a unique blend of a dynamic horn section, tight rhythm section, and exciting vocal artists.\n\nFree Thought Takeover has taken over venues such as Holocene, Alhambra Theater, Hawthorne Theater, Kelly\u2019s Olympian, Star Theater, Graffitti Fest, Green Valley Music Fest, and many more.\n\nThey\u2019ve been setting up stage with local Portland acts such as Glenn Waco, Elton Crey, Speaker Minds, The Sindicate & Dear Drummer, just to name a few.\n\nFree Thought Takeover isn\u2019t just a band name. The group has made notable efforts to enlighten and donate to causes concerning free speech, human rights, and media censorship. Eighty percent of the world does not have access to free press. All the news they read is altered. Free Thought Takeover wants to change that.\n\nFree Thought Takeover"},{"id":1857929824451361,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t31.0-0\/c0.206.480.173\/p480x480\/15591119_1196900630346139_6717284747680623695_o.jpg?oh=535fc5a7949889af40864cc6a0f4f6fb&oe=591EB3B3","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Rejoice!

When back braces, chiropractors, and yoga were not enough, she received corrective surgery in 2002; two stainless steel rods, twenty-two screws, and eleven fused vertebrae later, Abby found new meaning in the word flexibility, and a refreshed appreciation for the miracle that is one\u2019s body.\n\nShe took up distance running, cycling, and Ultimate Frisbee, and soon found herself pulled back to yoga. Through a balance of Vinyasa, Restorative, and Meditation practices, she built a stronger connection between her breath, body and mind \u2013 this connection followed her out of the studio and onto the Frisbee field, the race course, and into her daily life.\n\nIn every class that she teaches, Abby hopes to inspire her students to appreciate their bodies, stretch their limits, and never to take themselves too seriously.\n\nAbby\u2019s other interests include improv comedy, cooking, organic farming, and petting small dogs.\n\nFor her full story, or to contact Abby, visit her website at www.straightupyoga.com"},{"id":1827508810843669,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.26.555.201\/s480x480\/15940406_1196097067140490_4968782319377961230_n.jpg?oh=2b344c140dda1fa998b708b350998002&oe=591CBC26","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Composition & Arranging Clinic: Writing for Flute, Clarinet, Sax","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 12 PM","location":"Roseway Heights School\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"6 people interested","description":"Free and open to the Public - All ages are Welcome!\n\nThe third workshop in a series of four as part of the PJCE\u2019s Grasshoppers Student Composer Mentorship program.\n\nThese free workshops are aimed toward new and experienced composers interested in learning how to properly score and arrange parts for jazz instruments.

That is, until he finally had enough of way the audiences at the punk shows were constantly targeted by thugs and neo-Nazi skinheads and subjected to aggression and violence at their hands.\n\n \n\n He started to fight back against those who openly beat and maimed the city's young punks. Soon, he found himself providing security for the scene's underground shows. Thanks to the work of Ivan and his friends, today there\u2019s an established and healthy hardcore\/punk scene in Russia.\n\n Unfortunately \u2014 but predictably \u2014 Ivan's work led to his making not only friends, but enemies as well. In November of 2009, he was shot in the head at point-blank range in the doorway of his own home. \n\n In 2013, Ivan's friends pooled their resources to make a documentary film about his life and the circumstances surrounding his death. This film tells the story of a man who literally paid with his life for commitment to the ideals of kindness and humanism. In addition to Ivan's story, the film also provides a rare look into Moscow's underground punk scene in the 2000's and the conditions within which the Russian anti-fascist movement has been developing.\n\n \n\n Aside from Ivan's family and friends, members of such famous Russian and European bands as Distemper, Purgen, Naive, Tarakany!, What We Feel, and Stage Bottles, all of whom knew Ivan well, expressed their desire to also get involved in the project.\n\n After there will be djs playing antifascist oi and boss reggae.\n\n3 dollar donation.

Guests vote at the end of dinner, one chef wins, and we donate the proceeds to the winning chef's charity of choice."},{"id":1295269283879318,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.73.480.173\/p320x320\/15665713_1913442798883784_1828148719252894980_n.jpg?oh=932a7a7c89061d7c33f7ea80d4e9aed5&oe=59094464","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Bull Run Cider Tasting","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 2 PM","location":"McMenamins 23rd Avenue Bottle Shop\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"2 people interested","description":"Come enjoy a complimentary sample or two of  Bull Run Cider's tasty beverages."}],"paginationCursor":"eyJzdGFydF90aW1lIjoxNDg1NTkwNDAwLCJlbmRfdGltZSI6MTQ4NTY3Njc5OSwiYnJvd3NlX2N1cnNvciI6IkFickdlMFViUjJ3OVQxWkNZSGpwZDhpSzNvcnVMS1VCTFVkcGc4TE1CcmtYMWxEWHRaNWJvc1I2UFRfOW5nRU9MOW4xU0NPZFUydm1vaVlvaHZJUXY1YWZRMDY4bG1GZ3VrNzFTbW4tWE9ESHM5LVJpejFjSHVCRnFOZFNVLWRHUGE3NHVYazJRUms5ZERfUktxTXZUeTlhUVlVSEVIZ2J4ZVNBY3VrM09vcU93N0RieV9rNG9yTEhnTEtnRHk2Yno5S2pCUVgzUkQ4Q3Fnb25RZ0tXVTRZdDF4di1uaTE4M0pLd1NaZzZsOW1ZRTk2WlBEVUlfd0xyUXBISjlTYzVEWnVKdGs3TktyRWozLThFVjJ4VERTYUVKems2UG9OMWNpUERiaWNNQmdDUlpnIn0=","hasNextPage":true}],"isGroupedList":false},"bootloadable":{},"ixData":{},"lid":"6378539005821400051"}

All seen through the broken lenses of squashed sunglasses: fragments of shade, a social and formal ambiance of chiaroscuro. For her exhibition at Private Places, Heidi Schwegler acts as an urban archeologist collecting particular objects found on the streets and sidewalks. These everyday discarded things, once they are gathered and transformed become covered, cut, and coated sculptures, an arranged visual landscape. With their obvious use-value waned and their practical function amputated, they have such a curious resonance, something emotional and ambiguous, ranging from the whimsical to something more disturbing. \n\nChristopher Russell's new work, Self Destruct Mechanism, was made especially for exhibition at Private Places. This work continues Russell's practice of augmenting his scratched and abraded photographs with fiction writing and book design. His work involves an exploration of the darker aspects of the human psyche, in this instance examining notions of love and longing with visual metaphors as direct as painting with semen and as oblique as evoking night blooming flowers to reference the drunken booty call. Russell has produced an illustrated chapbook that will act as both guide and catalog to his work in the exhibition.\n\n\nSelf Destruct Mode \/\/ January 28, 2017- February 25, 2017\nContact: info\u0040privateplaces.com \/\/ Hours: By appointment\n\n\n\n\nAbout The Artists\n\n\n\nHeidi Schwegler\u2019s exhibitions include the Co\/Lab Art Fair (CA), Raid Projects, (CA), Platform China (Beijing), Scope Art 2004 (NY), and the Hallie Ford Museum (OR). Schwegler is a recent Ford Family Fellow, received a 2010 MacDowell Colony Fellowship and several RACC Individual Project Grants. Reviews of Schwegler\u2019s work have appeared in Art in America, Daily Serving, ArtNews and the Huffington Post. She earned her MFA from the University of Oregon and is Chair of the MFA in Applied Craft + Design, a joint program of Oregon College of Art and Craft, and the Pacific Northwest College of Art. Schwegler will also be exhibiting a solo project at Upfor Gallery in the Pearl District, Feb 22nd through April 1st.  \n\n\nRussell received his M.F.A. from the Art Center College of Design. He has had a solo exhibition at the Hammer Museum (Los Angeles) and has been featured in group exhibitions at the Tokyo Institute of Photography (Japan), The Norton Museum (West Palm Beach), White Columns (New York), De Appel Arts Center (Netherlands) and LACMA among others. He has published numerous critical articles in addition to being a featured subject of positive review by the Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Artillery, Frieze, and ArtForum, among others. His work is included in the collections of numerous institutions including the Brooklyn Museum; MCA-Chicago; MOCA, Los Angeles; M HKA, Antwerp; MFA, Houston; The J. P. Getty Museum; and the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, to name a few. Russell's work is currently on view at the Portland Art Museum in the exhibition, Photography and Contemporary Experience and will be featured in the upcoming exhibition, Cut! Paper Play in Contemporary Photography, at the J.P. Getty Museum in Spring of 2018. Russell is also known for his 'zine Bedwetter."},{"id":302249900176389,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.201.960.347\/s480x480\/15822677_925975460869977_7582076048171455988_n.jpg?oh=24929ade5cebf3056e9aa72d97ef1762&oe=59211371","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Men's Prayer Breakfast","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 8 AM","location":"Holgate Baptist Church\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"","description":"Men are invited to come eat great food, pray, and study God's Word together the last Saturday morning of each month.

We will spend the day alternating between demonstrations, fun exercises and technique drills... the nature of the day will be relaxed, full, and inspiring.\n\nWhat is ChiRunning?\nChiRunning goes beyond traditional running training by incorporating energy efficiency and injury prevention techniques into running form. Runners learn to use their core muscles while relaxing the rest of your body, untilizing gravity for forward propulsion, not the legs.
