Starring the Motown legend Diana Ross as the jazz idol Billie Holiday, the film was nominated in 1972 for five Oscars- Diana Ross stunned audiences with her gripping musical and acting interpretaion of Lady Day.  #portlandjazz #kboo #portland #billieholiday #blacklivesmatter  Suggested $7-10, but no one ever turned away for lack of funds!  Billie was a true artist of her day and rose as a social phenomenon from extreme poverty and prostitution to jazz superstar in the 1950s. Her soulful, unique singing voice and her ability to boldly turn any material that she confronted into her own music made her the rage of her time. Today, Holiday is remembered for her masterpieces, creativity and vivacity, as many of Holiday\u2019s songs are as well known today as they were decades ago. Holiday\u2019s poignant voice is still considered to be one of the greatest jazz voices of all time.\n\nHoliday (born Eleanora Fagan) grew up in jazz talent-rich Baltimore in the 1920s. As a young teenager, Holiday served the beginning part of her so-called \u201capprenticeship\u201d by singing along with records by Bessie Smith or Louis Armstrong in after-hours jazz clubs. When Holiday\u2019s mother, Sadie Fagan, moved to New York in search of a better job, Billie eventually went with her. She made her true singing debut in obscure Harlem nightclubs and borrowed her professional name \u2013 Billie Holiday \u2013 from screen star Billie Dove. Although she never underwent any technical training and never even so much as learned how to read music, Holiday quickly became an active participant in what was then one of the most vibrant jazz scenes in the country. She would move from one club to another, working for tips. She would sometimes sing with the accompaniment of a house piano player while other times she would work as part of a group of performers.\n\nAt the age of 18 and after gaining more experience than most adult musicians can claim, Holiday was spotted by John Hammond and cut her first record as part of a studio group led by Benny Goodman, who was then just on the verge of public prominence. In 1935 Holiday\u2019s career got a big push when she recorded four sides that went on to become hits, including \u201cWhat a Little Moonlight Can Do\u201d and \u201cMiss Brown to You.\u201d This landed her a recording contract of her own, and then, until 1942, she recorded a number of master tracks that would ultimately become an important building block of early American jazz music.\n\nHoliday began working with Lester Young in 1936, who pegged her with her now-famous nickname of \u201cLady Day.\u201d When Holiday joined Count Basie in 1937 and then Artie Shaw in 1938, she became one of the very first black women to work with a white orchestra, an impressive accomplishment of her time.\n\nIn the 1930s, when Holiday was working with Columbia Records, she was first introduced to the poem \u201cStrange Fruit,\u201d an emotional piece about the lynching of a black man. Though Columbia would not allow her to record the piece due to subject matter, Holiday went on to record the song with an alternate label, Commodore, and the song eventually became one of Holiday\u2019s classics. It was \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d that eventually prompted Lady Day to continue more of her signature, moving ballads.\n\nHoliday recorded about 100 new recordings on another label, Verve, from 1952 to 1959. Her voice became more rugged and vulnerable on these tracks than earlier in her career. During this period, she toured Europe, and made her final studio recordings for the MGM label in March of 1959.\n\nDespite her lack of technical training, Holiday\u2019s unique diction, inimitable phrasing and acute dramatic intensity made her the outstanding jazz singer of her day. White gardenias, worn in her hair, became her trademark. \u201cSinging songs like the \u2018The Man I Love\u2019 or \u2018Porgy\u2019 is no more work than sitting down and eating Chinese roast duck, and I love roast duck,\u201d she wrote in her autobiography. \u201cI\u2019ve lived songs like that.\u201d\n\nBillie Holiday, a musical legend still popular today, died an untimely death at the age of 44. Her emotive voice, innovative techniques and touching songs will forever be remembered and enjoyed."},{"id":1761446640845254,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.8.300.172\/p75x225\/15726492_1707249935967202_8130821974830128314_n.jpg?oh=f494b0217fabf852fb5e7865395dc1b7&oe=59090ACF","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c90.0.780.780\/s173x172\/14344707_10154575479213217_7649286442926331380_n.jpg?oh=d9acead72a289dc83dde268017c94d59&oe=59243382","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/1761446640845254\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"80's Week-Sixteen Candles","day":"23","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Tomorrow 8:30 PM","location":"McMenamins Mission Theater\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"124 people interested","description":"McMenamins 80's Week continues with Sixteen Candles.

Yaron Amar of Shila, Adam Barzilay of Shile Restaurant Group, and Ron Gibori of Jeremiah in Tel Aviv will prepare an Israeli feast at PLAZA DEL TORO on January 20th, offer dishes on Shalom Y\u2019all and MEC\u2019s dinner menus, and cook a collaborative dinner with Toro Bravo Inc\u2019s John Gorham and MEC\/Shalom Y\u2019all\u2019s Kasey Mills on January 27th.\n\nABOUT THE CHEFS\nAdam Barzilay studied at the culinary school in Israel and worked as a pastry chef at some of the leading restaurants there, including Toto, and Herbert Samuel at the Ritz Carlton in Tel Aviv. He honed his skills staging in the Provence region of France, in a Michelin star country restaurant, and attending a Chocolatier school. Currently, Adam is the head Pastry chef for the Shile Restaurant Group, which encompass some of the best restaurants in Tel Aviv: Shila, Caf\u00e9 Europa, Shipudey Europa, Europa Gelatery, and Florentine house. Adam\u2019s family is originally from Yemen, and he grew up savoring all the traditional Jewish-Yemenite foods, such as Jahnun, Mala\u2019uah, Kubana, and Ox-tail soup.\n \nYaron Amar studied at the culinary school in Israel, staged in Italy and at the 3 Michelin stars Lameloise in Bourgogne. Worked at some of the leading Israeli restaurants including Roshfeld and Roshfeld Bistro in Tel Aviv where he eventually became the head chef. Currently, Yaron is the Chef de Cuisine at Shila, the leading Israeli seafood restaurant in Tel Aviv, and part of the same Shile Restaurant Group where Adam Barzilay is working. Besides Israeli cuisine, Yaron has specialized in butchery and French and Italian cuisines. He is passionate about the Moroccan cuisine of his family roots. Growing up, he was inspired by his hardworking Mom, cooking some divine traditional signature dishes such as couscous, and fish in spicy sauce. And his dad helping at times with his own Moroccan specialties, such as his delicous Matbu\u2019ha.\n \nRon Gibori is the nephew of Toro Bravo Inc business partner Ron Avni and has been our main Israeli restaurant coordinator during our own chefs\u2019 visits in Israel. Gibori opened his own restaurant, Jeremiah, in Tel Aviv at the exact same month in which we opened our first restaurant, Toro Bravo. (He sold Jeremiah two years ago.) Ron studied at the culinary school in Israel, won top sommelier at Israel's wine expo, and worked at some of the leading restaurants in Israel, such as Roshfeld, Catit and Seatara, either as a front of house manager or as general manager. Gibori grew up in Vered HaGalil, the charming guest ranch that was founded by his grandfather, Yehuda Avni, and has been a source of inspiration for some of the dishes and themes at both Mediterranean Exploration Company and at Shalom Y\u2019All."},{"id":236466650097777,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.228.320.183\/p320x320\/15941251_1312839328779344_4452247855580169120_n.jpg?oh=a71b74f330e9d49fca0c5b22a071bec4&oe=58FFBCA5","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c90.1.780.780\/s173x172\/535668_608512532503805_1603625687_n.jpg?oh=c6d1c4e05fe46bf59b86d13d288fbb45&oe=5915D032","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/236466650097777\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"PDX Mandem & Neill Von Tally at Produce Row","day":"23","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Tomorrow 7 PM","location":"Produce Row Cafe\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"43 people interested","description":"PDX Mandem (Skelli Skel & Ian Millhollen)\nNeill Von Tally\n+ Guest MCs\nperforming a live set mixing Djing, live beat making and guest MC cypher at Produce Row Cafe\n\nFREE - All ages from 7-9 PM\n21+ from 9-10 PM"},{"id":259417234471395,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c78.0.300.172\/p173x172\/15826199_1305282022863167_7218883990138248842_n.jpg?oh=7f13e1179a69fa9e5cf4fe16e21e0590&oe=591667F3","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c90.0.780.780\/s173x172\/13096089_1091691867555518_8112747509571303911_n.jpg?oh=2d9050ac5acd46e319db8acdd1d0e644&oe=591B81D4","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/259417234471395\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Dan Layus w\/ Streaming in the Skype Live Studio","day":"23","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Tomorrow 12 PM","location":"Skype Live Studio\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"5 people going","description":"Watch Dan Layus' live Kink.fm performance at 12:00pm PDT on 01\/23 in the Studio or stream the show at www.skypelivestudio.com by clicking \"live stream\" in the top right corner.\n\nPresented by Keep Oregon Well\n\nEnter to win tickets at www.skypelivestudio.com if you want to be part of the live audience for the session taping.\n\n#CloserWithSkype #KeepOregonWell"},{"id":715474461944884,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.54.320.183\/p320x320\/15965168_1313431538680319_4546927052758321716_n.jpg?oh=9d737e2212dc3cf1c853c0512bad7ab5&oe=592194BD","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c41.0.357.357\/s173x172\/14718869_707417776073043_4080404221828332031_n.jpg?oh=cf06b79cb26bfdda6aac91d027d49d5e&oe=591D77D6","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/715474461944884\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Lecture: Sharon Danks, National Greening of Schoolyards Movement","day":"23","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Tomorrow 6:30 PM","location":"Ecotrust\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"6 people interested","description":"Don't miss this visit from a star of the national greening schoolyards movement!\n\nThe Intertwine Alliance is honored to bring author and inspirational leader Sharon Danks from the Bay Area to Portland for a free evening lecture on the topic of children and nature. Sharon is CEO and founder of Green Schoolyards America, an organization that leads the national greening of schoolyards movement and empowers individuals to become stewards of their school and neighborhood environments. \n\nResearch shows a direct connection between healthy school environments and a child\u2019s achievement and physical and mental health. Traveling the world to study hundreds of school sites and understand best practices, Sharon has turned that knowledge and experience into her inspiring book, Asphalt to Ecosystems: Design Ideas for Schoolyard Transformation. Sharon speaks around the country about the need to create nature-focused environments in which children can thrive. \n\nThe talk will be of interest to educators, school administrators, environmental and natural resource professionals, health care providers and anyone else concerned about the health and well-being of the children in our region. \n\nSharon\u2019s visit is part of a regional Greening of Schoolyards Planning Project that The Intertwine Alliance is facilitating on behalf of dozens of community organizations and school districts. Its goal is to diminish the barriers and catalyze the development of school gardens, nature play areas and outdoor classrooms in all schools in the four-county region.\n\nPlease RSVP for Sharon's lecture today! It's free and open to the public.\n\nQuestions?

We\u2019ve got a bunch of people just like you, and we want to hear all about it! \n\nThe Game Design Lounge is for game players, game designers, or otherwise game thinkers to get together and share their ideas and inspiration. Maybe you have a current game design project, or just some early concepts, or maybe you have some observations about play generally. Let\u2019s talk about it!\n\nWe open the lounge at 7pm with open discussion and mixer - mingle and get acquainted with people and their topics. At 7:30 we split up into discussion groups. Each topic gets about 20 minutes of airtime. The event is officially over at 9pm, but you are free to linger if you like!\n\nIf you are an active game designer working on a project please join us for our Game Designer Scrum at 6:30pm for workflow discussion and goal setting.\n\nThe Game Garden is part of the Games to Gather network and adheres to Games to Gather's values and policies.

Friends, family members and others who want to be of support to individuals who have gone through these sometimes disorienting and difficult experiences are also welcome.\n\nSpiritual Awakening: An abiding realization of the illusory nature of one's ego identity and the concurrent realization of one's true nature as infinite, eternal awareness and unconditional love. The ego identity drops away, and although it may partially rebuild itself at times, the awareness of what is true is never really lost. One\u2019s perspective on reality is thoroughly altered causing changes in how one relates to his or her life and its purpose.\n\nDetails:\nWe meet on the 2nd and 4th Mondays of each month to share our stories and discuss topics related to our spiritual awakenings and transformations in a compassionate and judgement-free environment. Our goal is to explore the deeper meanings of these experiences and to support ourselves and each other in integrating these changes into our lives in ways that support the continuing unfolding of our truest selves.\n\nNewcomers welcome! Please be sure to RSVP if you would like to attend as we have limited space. at: http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Spiritual-Awakening-Network\n\n\nA $4 donation per person is requested to cover Meet-up dues and space rental fees.

There are two versions of how Robin and Polly Holmes, both Missouri slaves, came to Oregon. One, told by Robin Holmes, is that his owner, Nathaniel Ford, persuaded him to come in exchange for his freedom. The other, told by Ford descendants, is that Holmes begged to come and Ford brought Holmes\u2014and Holmes\u2019 wife and children\u2014against his better judgment.\u000b\u000b\n\nWhichever version is correct, and certainly Holmes\u2019 version is most believable, the family of slaves joined a wagon train of fifty-four wagons in 1844 for an eight-month journey along the Oregon Trail from Independence, Missouri. It was among the first emigrant wagon trains to leave for Oregon, and Robin and Polly Holmes would be among the first African Americans to live in Oregon. They brought their three small children, and settled with the Ford family in what is now Polk County. \n\n\u000b\u000bYears later, Holmes and Ford would face each other in a landmark court case that would help shape Oregon\u2019s policy toward slavery and slaves. The case was a habeas corpus suit brought by Holmes against Ford in 1852 seeking custody of his children, who Ford tried to keep. A remarkable feature of the case is that it provides a rare written record of the relationship between a slave-owner and a slave\u2014from the slave\u2019s point of view."},{"id":1850898005154353,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.34.301.173\/p240x240\/16114324_1761799767472953_454891314590031826_n.jpg?oh=b1e2e5c358bba08d5a9f47b6c1b35d7e&oe=5903E410","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c68.105.585.585\/s173x172\/14184344_1677862389200025_7089257391491561548_n.jpg?oh=66aa5b103868d0edc01ebedbb959bdaa&oe=591986A8","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/1850898005154353\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Waiting for Spring","day":"23","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Tomorrow 6:30 PM","location":"Paint and Sip\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Longview, WA","socialContext":"18 people interested","description":"ADVANCED TICKET PURCHASE REQUIRED."},{"id":1350332531675880,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.148.320.183\/p320x320\/16114933_1048868771909020_6219345445306345833_n.jpg?oh=7f3bf4ecf4c5032263273d1ce67d2396&oe=59103518","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c95.0.561.561\/s173x172\/15253441_1166476953429276_8091336103999517547_n.jpg?oh=1427baf520f9f072352aaf49ada64382&oe=591A009C","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/1350332531675880\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Show Your Support: NWIW Shorelines Permit Hearing","day":"23","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Jan 23 - Jan 24","location":"Cowlitz County Event Center\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Longview, WA","socialContext":"9 people interested","description":"Thank you for your support of the proposed NW Innovation Works project -- it is making an impact!\nThe next major milestone is the upcoming Shorelines Permit Hearing in Longview, WA on January 23-25, 2017 (more details below).\nWE NEED YOUR VOICE!\nIf you care about improving the local Cowlitz County economy through job creation and increased county tax revenue, we need your voice.\nIf you care about innovative solutions that help the world transition to a cleaner future, we need your voice.\nIf you care about safe and environmentally responsible approaches to creating the products we use every day, we need your voice.\nTHE DETAILS:\nWhat: \nShorelines Permit Public Hearing & Supporter Rally\nWhen: \n\u2022 The public hearing is 9:00 am - 5:00 pm daily, January 23-24, 2017.

We'll work on clarifying who influences who and what so that you can be the most effective advocate you can be for wildlands, wildlife, and waters! \n\nJoin us!"},{"id":1807801416104009,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.12.308.177\/p200x200\/15727358_1539479972734019_1360780209697586577_n.jpg?oh=04de4c6accc57f85f58e10ab08b55a6f&oe=5915BC73","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c33.170.381.381\/s173x172\/13754212_10153484579476377_1914364726561808021_n.jpg?oh=e672e6a1cf415ce48eba9ffc087a22dd&oe=590D8AB0","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/1807801416104009\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"TCD Monthly Meeting","day":"23","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Tomorrow 7 PM","location":"Thurston County of - Courthouse Complex Information\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Olympia, WA","socialContext":"34 people going","description":"Looking forward to seeing everyone at the first meeting of 2017!\n\nThere's lots to discuss and plan for the coming year as we look to improve our organization and keep member engagement high.\n\n***Reminder***\nMembership for 2017 is due Feb. 1st!\nVisit our page to sign up or renew.\nhttp:\/\/www.thurstondemocrats.org\/membership"},{"id":1214659415238628,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.48.308.177\/p206x206\/15871840_1215666058521193_6527057661775727866_n.jpg?oh=f7c4150314e87e17e2ce0b203f1dd310&oe=5909BE4E","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c148.0.665.665\/s173x172\/12032103_10153518278255943_8315015396842480068_n.jpg?oh=ff01f9097a1a6589c6d6b35af1face90&oe=590B083F","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/1214659415238628\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Microsoft Excel","day":"23","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Tomorrow 5:30 PM","location":"Grays Harbor College\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Aberdeen, WA","socialContext":"6 people interested","description":"Learn the basic features of Microsoft Excel and spreadsheet concepts to record, organize, and keep track of data.

Recent research has revealed that Dr. Keil and the Aurora Colony were intimately involved with these settlers: in politics, business, and Oregon society in general. These established networks between the pioneers led to the development of a prosperous hop growing business in the French Prairie that lasted until the years of prohibition.  There are quite a few stories with names familiar to our region---Boone, Feller, Meeker etc\n\nAll of these strands came together at Aurora in 1874 where the newly organized Oregon Pioneer Association held a reunion that attracted 1500 pioneers and family members- yet another example of the cooperation and enduring ties between the Aurora Colonists and the Oregon 1840\u2019s pioneers. We can only imagine the \u201cgood spirits\u201d that flowed during that reunion.\n\nPresented by speaker Patrick Harris, come to the Midway Pub January 24th for \"The French Prairie: Oregon's Historic Heartland 1843-1918\"!

We\u2019ll reconnect with our natural intelligence through a range of practices - including meditation, Authentic Movement, writing and image-making to tune in to the voice of the body. \n \nMoving in a small group creates safety and ease, as well as a gentle way to practice being diplomatic & kind to your body\/mind. These six sessions form a nurturing and easy way to restore a feeling of embodied presence. \n\nNo prior movement experience is needed or preferred. Also suitable for experienced movers. Class size is limited to 8 and pre-registration is requested. \n\nElizabeth Russell is the owner and director of Be Space. Her training is in Performance & Movement Studies from Naropa University. There, she was privileged to practice with many great teachers, including Barbara Dilley, Lee Worley, Mark Miller, Paul Oertel, and Annie Brook.

With his warm infectious smile he brings people together, encouraging comradeship and building community. Though it's undeniable that he loves the music and he\u2019s a hell of a banjo picker to boot. Offering rowdy singer\/songwriter solo shows, he blends gritty originals and tasteful covers, weaving together 3 finger banjo, clawhammer and flat-picking guitar songs into his sets. Sung with a bit of gravel in his throat, his sultry tunes are sure to keep the crowds attention.\n\nBorn and raised in Savannah, GA, Austin Quattlebaum's sound is tinged with southern low country marsh land blues. After living in the mountains of southern Appalachia for several years his sound became steeped in traditional bluegrass and old time music . After 8 years of wilderness river guiding and living in a van as a touring musician, it\u2019s grown it into a sound all it's own.\n\nwww.austinquattlebaum.com\/"},{"id":1865831580313133,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.14.300.172\/p200x200\/15085661_10153837191451441_961406257390944896_n.jpg?oh=778ea0337bfe8a507ef1f3d17734c772&oe=590E44D5","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c90.0.779.779\/s173x172\/11960150_10152958210746441_8351270687574222101_n.jpg?oh=f8ac5cd3152438b8493ba363d49a0285&oe=5900F06B","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/1865831580313133\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"January - Special Board Meeting","day":"24","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Tue 5:30 PM","location":"Evergreen Public Schools\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Vancouver, WA","socialContext":"6 people interested","description":"All meetings are open to the public (with the exception of executive sessions).
