The rest of the time will be spent using these movements to execute competitive speed drills that will challenge the athletes to fatigue.\n\nBecause we want to make sure the athletes get the most out of their experience there will only be 24 spots available for ages 11-18. Since this is the first Speed Camp at CCS we are offering it for the discounted price of $10.\n\nCamp will be January 28th from 5-7pm. Please arrive 15 minutes early.

The band started playing together in March of 2013 in preparation for an anniversary party for Double Mountain Brewery in Hood River, OR. After the first gig the Greennecks knew they were on to something. Each member of the band brings unique style to the table. \n     Singer\/ songwriter Billy Sheeley has a great mixture of original songs crossing into many different genres of music, mixing in a certain southern twang showcasing his South Austin up-bringing.\n     Matt Farmer also of The Shed Shakers has amazing harmonies and electrifying mandolin solos. Matt is a mover and Shaker in The Columbia River Gorge music scene finding his way onto many stages around the area.\n     Ryan Kolberg is a professionally trained stand-up bass player with a degree from the Berkley School of Music. Ryan lays down a solid bass line in every type of song Billy throws at him\n     Matt Swihart, owner\/ operator of Double Mountain Brewery in Hood River, OR is definitely the wild card. Not only is Matt a ripping banjo player with fantastic harmonies, his charisma and sense of humor come through at the live performances.\n     Andrew Mcwilliams is also one of the best resophonic guitar players in the Gorge. With his amazing solos and melodic rhythms Andrew rounds out the band as real force in Bluegrass.\n\n These forces combine create a sound that has something for everyone. Great original songs with fun harmonies.\n\n\nBand Interests\nSkiing Powder, Rafting. \n\nArtists We Also Like\nJohn Prine, Tom Petty, Trampled By Turtles, Del Mcoury Band, Ryan Bingham, Steve Earl, Justin Townes Earl\n\nwww.greenneckdaredevils.com"},{"id":314288315611248,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c78.0.300.172\/p173x172\/11222367_10154214861423127_8260509478449066354_n.jpg?oh=92428bc70528c709a60c6132a3b26eb4&oe=590F909C","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c133.0.693.693\/s173x172\/14570405_10154230389163127_5273172425629749699_n.jpg?oh=74af6e16c613f5580511ffc85784ced0&oe=5912116B","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/314288315611248\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Oregon State Gymnastics vs UCLA","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 1:30 PM","location":"Corvallis, Oregon","socialContext":"37 people interested","description":""},{"id":231338283980591,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t31.0-0\/c0.3.480.173\/p480x480\/15875340_10154168711120233_6853082785203848822_o.jpg?oh=5aa284bf5ce6ce279655123e3501555e&oe=590434B5","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Mountain Music Series: Dancehall Days","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 2 PM","location":"Crystal Mountain Resort\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Enumclaw, WA","socialContext":"4 people going","description":"Dancehall Days is back again!

Together, they earned Masters degrees in music at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro. They completed their studies on scholarship for a year with maestro Jose Luis Rodrigo at the Royal Conservancy of Music in Madrid, Spain. During their year in Spain, the duo received scholarships to study at the international Spanish music festival in Santiago de Compostela and the Manuel de Falla International Music Festival in Granada, including a course with composer Luigi Nono. Upon their return to the United States, the duo recorded a critically acclaimed CD and pursued a rigorous concert schedule, including performances in New York, Calgary, and throughout the southeast and pacific northwest. \n\nThe duo has commissioned several new works for two guitars including Three Cherokee Legends by Sarah Pierce, Kootenai East, Op. 56 by Michael E. Young, Pentamerisms by Michael Daugherty, and Water Leaves by Bruce Reiprich.\n\nA forgotten manuscript of duets by Isidro de Laporta (fl. 1790-1820) on the shelves of the Royal Conservatory library in Madrid introduced Neil and Tamara to a wealth of early nineteenth century music for two guitars. They are currently bringing this repertoire to life through research in archival sources and a study of historically informed performance practices. Neil plays a replica of a guitar made in Mirecourt, France, by Aubry-Maire in 1840 and Tamara plays an original anonymous French instrument from about 1825. \n\nLearn more about the duo at:\nwww.caulkinsguitarduo.com"},{"id":1835118910076886,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t31.0-0\/c0.432.480.173\/p480x480\/16112888_1319001674828284_2937205957868806715_o.jpg?oh=12483b57482c3abbf12d7f98969235b2&oe=5906B1AA","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Painting Uncorked #2","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 1 PM","location":"Union Square\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Longview, WA","socialContext":"7 people interested","description":"$30.00 per painter\nCome relax Pour the paint Pop the cork\nBring a friend or come and meet some new friends\nWe will be imaging we are somewhere else nice and warm"},{"id":362366367476109,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.165.960.347\/s480x480\/15977133_1743665115659378_4732099795570048161_n.jpg?oh=b9c420b8a430d50bf0f60b76ec0d7a25&oe=590F1C21","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"RTB Doubles","day":"28","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sat 12 PM","location":"Linn Lanes\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Lebanon","socialContext":"7 people going","description":"An 80\u0025 of 215 handicap doubles event featuring 5 games of qualifying action with a top 3 stepladder if we get a minimum of 12 teams.

Mini Blinds was formed in Portland, Oregon in late 2015, the duo consists of Beth Ann Dear and Devin Welch, whom have grown up in the Pacific Northwest and have participated in it\u2019s booming music scene for many years.

Given the pervasive levels of trauma within our society, many students who attend public yoga classes carry the physical, emotional and energetic residue of trauma within their shape and may be more vulnerable to being re-traumatized or feeling triggered in this context. Understanding how a student with a history of trauma might relate to you and your class can enhance your ability as a teacher to create a space where they can incrementally practice presence, listen to the language of their body, and experience the healing power of yoga.\n\nThe instructor draws from a combination of direct experience, professional work, and academic research, enabling her to attest to both the potential vulnerabilities and the inherent resilience of this population. Participants will learn about the spectrum of traumatic events\/experiences and explore a variety of perspectives on trauma theory as well as key methods to promote holistic healing through yoga. The training will be delivered in a manner that is inclusive of survivors of trauma \u2013 creating a unique space for participants to gain clarity around how their own process of healing can serve as a resource in their teaching.\n\nWhether you seek to offer classes specifically for survivors of trauma or you simply desire additional tools to make appropriate modifications within your public classes, this training will provide you with options, information and confidence in how to create a more trauma-informed space. This workshop will include a trauma-informed yoga practice.\n\nCost: $100 (or as part of the TPY Teacher Training tuition)\n\nWe will meet from 9-Noon and 2-5pm at the NE Second Studio: 5428 NE 30th Ave."}],"paginationCursor":"eyJzdGFydF90aW1lIjoxNDg1Njc2ODAwLCJlbmRfdGltZSI6MTQ4NTc2MzE5OSwiYnJvd3NlX2N1cnNvciI6IkFicGdLZGYyeGNQa2tOWmpFeFU5VXN1NU9tTE1jbEtweUNxeHQtMzBvRnViZllITkYtZm1vUmlMMnNOX0F3YndhMDNUaktPV3p4YjNmajJ3eUIxYlczdEZCOEh4dXlNN3ppbElKUVhjblhDRU5DRk9QR0pLazZ3S0VydEV2V3FTN3l3WmY4V1hhQ1ZFLVFqajBLZUZTYVRUNldjemJ0c29TWFJldnBOdjNVMXhpeUpuRkVkajJISjVkdGswUi1WZmE3d01HZGtfM2R6OUw5LWRmdG9YMmtlcVVKa0s4cEVfbE92YV9UYUlQdWF2ZVlrRWZGU29LZldVU0tOLU03LXJ4YlJiMjFCZzllY1lmSnF4Q0tkcUhxUjNvX2NmWWFrN0t2UnFJSkFMTHlxYnMtalNUbXRIYWdjbDFma1dmSjNEWDdFIn0=","hasNextPage":true}],"isGroupedList":false},"bootloadable":{},"ixData":{},"lid":"6378541693860956827"}

After more than 40 years of service as PWCL, we are excited to embrace a new identity as Call to Safety.\r\n\r\nOur new identity better reflects who we are and what we do:\r\n\r\nWe serve Portland and beyond, supporting callers and organizations across Oregon and Washington;\r\nCall to Safety supports individuals of all genders;\r\nOur 24\/7 crisis line is just one of our core services along with our sexual assault services, follow-up advocacy, and community outreach and education.\r\n \r\n\r\nCall to Safety is not just a social service agency \u2013 we were founded as a social change organization. Domestic and sexual violence are widespread. We are dedicated to supporting those who experience violence in empowering themselves while working to end the oppressions at the root of violence (like racism, sexism, transmisogyny, and ableism).\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/thegoobsrock.bandcamp.com\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/coolschmool.bandcamp.com\/releases"}],"paginationCursor":"eyJzdGFydF90aW1lIjoxNDg1Njc2ODAwLCJlbmRfdGltZSI6MTQ4NTc2MzE5OSwiYnJvd3NlX2N1cnNvciI6IkFib2htQ0NuLUl1WEh6MEZobHdKZUtrQk11OGFvZlBxOUpEdWluYXA3MUZDc2pEUXdkZXpJdFQ2UU5BcGVIdkRrME5RTkEyamt4MjhuWFJkaEt4cWxXYzRjTXkyYUJmU2pnTnVwRXVDLTNRUGRWb0wycEVudW9SU2ZXaFhlLUZrbWduRmhyVllBZm1fN3p0SHB2VmVLclIyZnpfRFNqTDVRLWZjRE41SlNWRVpwRmZrQ2U5RURfV0ZsRG95TzBlRjdwaUU0cWlyUWtDbUszbnRuTGpGbU1weTJNUklBUWFYdUxqREVhMFk2QmYxMXItVXVjaHRGcGNiRVZadDZTNDVJVmdsNTVQdVFSV2VkUzdvOTE3ZnVsc1ZKMGFwbWdMcC1LcG0tMVdSUUY3ZnlBIn0=","hasNextPage":true}],"isGroupedList":false},"bootloadable":{},"ixData":{},"lid":"6378541827814452449"}

Hopefully we will have warmer weather by the end of January and that's why we are scheduling the first bully walk of 2017 for that day.\n\nWe'll still like to honor our good friends at Original Bully, Amy White and Dwight Hovland, dog Panik and hopefully they will be able to join us.\n\nWell this is the beginning of year six of the bully walks and we hope that you will all continue to participate so we can show the people of Portland that our dogs are great and safe dogs because we choose to be responsible dog owners.\n\nAs always please observe our guidelines that are not meant to exclude anyone or to limit anyone but are designed to provide a safe and enjoyable event for everyone.\n\nGUIDELINES:\n\n1. NO FACING OFF: Please help your dog(s) greet other dogs with respect by observing simple \u2018dog rules\u2019 of meeting. Allow nose sniffing and then the obligatory butt sniffing while remaining calm and attentive yourself. Our dogs sense whether or not we are comfortable with them meeting other dogs so we must not allow meetings with other dogs unless we are comfortable with it. Please do not keep a taut leash while your dog is greeting\/meeting other dogs (remember that dog fighters use this method of keeping the leash taut and pulling back while dogs face off in order to get their dogs into a fighting mindset). Please don\u2019t ever assume that someone else wants their dog to meet yours so please be polite and make sure to ask permission before allowing your dog to meet\/greet another dog.\n\n2. NO RETRACTABLE LEASHES.\n\n3. RED BANDANNAS FOR \u2018DOG SENSITIVE\u2019 DOGS: Dogs known or believed to be anxious when around other dogs are to wear a red bandanna to let others know to respect your dog\u2019s space.\n4. ALL DOGS UP TO DATE ON SHOTS\/VACCINATIONS.  In the interest of good health for all the dogs attending our walks we ask that you do not join us unless your dog is up to date on their shots\/vaccinations.\n\n5. PICK UP AFTER YOUR DOG: If you don't have poop bags we have them. Just see one of the advocacy members at the walk to get some.\n\n6. NO SMOKING: We ask all of our bully walkers who smoke to please avoid smoking during the meet-up, the walk and after walk cool down. We make no judgment as to whether or not smoking is acceptable but do not want to promote it either as our walks are a family event. Smoking outside the periphery of where the bully walkers are gathered is perfectly acceptable. Thank you for understanding."},{"id":597252530467447,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.14.300.172\/p200x200\/16114106_10210206082981847_8182810362374955910_n.jpg?oh=f7edfecb05524c468006a195997514bd&oe=59012069","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c90.0.780.780\/s173x172\/15284842_1175992855815628_1288514423713099419_n.jpg?oh=7ef2d4631e02b9665afdcc66d012115e&oe=590758F2","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/597252530467447\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Support Organizers Sharing Session","day":"29","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Sun 3 PM","location":"Portland, Oregon","socialContext":"6 people interested","description":"All Welcome to join the Sharing, Planning, Organizing to support those on the ground at Standing Rock camps.

In our first half, we have John's songs and songs from other artists whose message and spirit parallel John's; songs that celebrate musical messages of love, life, home, and our responsibility as citizens of planet Earth.\n\nAfter the intermission hosted by our hospitality crew, the shorter second half is a time of high energy and emotion celebrating John's fascination with the music of others who enjoyed \"showing  off a little\" for him and their audiences. We then end our show on a wonderful note of honoring the great virtue of John being amazed with other artists and the purity of his desire for us all to realize a world free of comparison, competition, and criticism. To take this concept one step further, we\u2019ve also included works by artists and bands that we know John would have loved and likely shared the stage with if he had the chance.\n\nIt will be a great time of amazement, good times, and yes, maybe even a few tears, and some \"Did you see that?\" moments!

Hold onto your seat for a fun afternoon of  death defying music!\n\nStep right up as the band performs the North American premiere of \u201cFellini\u201d by Johan de Meij. The music captures the spirit of Italian film director Federico Fellini in the setting of a circus. The composer describes this as a piece \u201cfor alto saxophone, circus band, and wind orchestra.\u201d Let local saxophonist Randy Kem amaze you with his virtuosity, even though it appears that he\u2019s simply clowning around. (Have you ever seen a saxophonist perform while riding a clowncycle? Something truly spectacular to see and hear!) The band will also engage the spirit of Fellini by performing the Symphonic Suite from \u201cLa Strada\u201d (The Road) by Nino Rota. This music from Fellini\u2019s 1954 Academy Award winning film captures an excursion by street entertainers (street circus) through the Italian countryside filled with joy and sorrow.\n\nBut wait \u2014 there\u2019s more! \u201cCircus Ring\u201d by Paul Hart and \u201cThe Ringmaster\u2019s March\u201d by John Mackey invoke all the pageantry, humor, and animal acts of the circus, with a bit of a twist.  You will also hear not one, but two classic circus marches \u2014 \u201cThe Circus Bee\u201d by Henry Fillmore and \u201cBarnum and Bailey\u2019s Favorite\u201d by Karl King.
