After many years in the LA underground scene, she started releasing original tracks and charting on Beatport. Her debut track (and now Diva theme song) \u201cGhettoWork\u201d spent 6 months on the Beatport House 100. In 2015 she struck gold with \u201cI Got A Man,\u201d a collaboration with DJ Dan, spending a month in the House Top 10. With a fierce desire to promote women in music alongside an affinity for unicorns, Danielle trail blazed her way through the California music scene with her self-dubbed brand, 'Music 4 Unicorns,\u2019 a mix of bouncy House, bassy Tech House and funky Nu Disco. Much like the mythical creature, divaDanielle is one of a kind.\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Music4Unicorns\/\n\n\nDJ Wiggles (aka Ernest Ryan)\n\nErnest\u2019s father was a musician and the first to inspire his love of music at a very young age. However it wasn\u2019t until his teenage years that his passion for electronic dance music blossomed. After attending several warehouse parties in the mid 90s, Ernest began helping organize events as a volunteer for the One Tribe Collective of Portland \u2013 a conscious group of event promoters and artists. House music legends such as Mark Farina, DJ Dan, Donald Glaude, Barry Weaver and more were early influences, and would later help define his own unique sound.\n\nIt was February of 2001 when Ernest stepped out from behind the scenes and made his debut as DJ Wiggles. His vigor for performing quickly had him playing in Portland most every weekend while travelling out of town to share his music in other States. Later that year he would start forming the W&F Events crew and begin organizing and promoting many successful events in the area. Over a decade later he is still a favorite at many clubs and festivals.

Formed during an impromptu late-night jam at Jazz Fest 2012 in New Orleans, the relentlessly funky and soulful band believes in music as a higher power -- tapping into an energy that is simultaneously sexy and spiritual, with songs that will inspire audiences to dance, groove, make love or just stand there with goose bumps.The quintet hails from diverse musical backgrounds, races and creeds. Female powerhouse Nikki Glaspie was Beyonce's world-touring drummer for five years before she joined Ivan Neville's New Orleans funk outfit, Dumpstaphunk. Bassist Nate Edgar of Groovechild and John Brown's Body perfectly compliments Singer and Guitarist Nick Cassarino who came from the Jennifer Hartswick Band and toured with Big Daddy Kane. Next add West African Master-Percussionist, Weedie Braimah to the mix with his insurmountable world beat rhythms. Finally rounding off the ensemble is the newest and youngest member, Courtney J'Mell Smith who brings his soulful vocals and keyboard abilities to the table.\nTickets:\nhttp:\/\/www.ticketweb.com\/fb\/7026705\/dantes\n\nAbout Aniana:\nAniana has been seen performing in Portland for over seven years with multiple bands, such as Philly's Phunkestra, Ben Darwish\u2019s Commotion, Marv Ellis, Funk N' Roses, Yak Attack, the Asher Fulero Band, Fresh Track, and many others.

To that end we are inviting chefs to take over our kitchen and work with our teams to create unique culinary experiences in a series of events.\n \nOur January 2017 Chef in Residence series features four Israeli dinner events with three renowned chefs from Tel Aviv at PLAZA DEL TORO, Shalom Y\u2019all, and Mediterranean Exploration Company. Yaron Amar of Shila, Adam Barzilay of Shile Restaurant Group, and Ron Gibori of Jeremiah in Tel Aviv will prepare a Moroccan-influenced feast at PLAZA DEL TORO on January 20th, offer dishes on Shalom Y\u2019all and MEC\u2019s dinner menus, and cook a collaborative Yemenite-influenced dinner with Toro Bravo Inc\u2019s John Gorham and MEC\/Shalom Y\u2019all\u2019s Kasey Mills on January 27th. Please find event and chef details below.\n\nABOUT THE CHEFS:\nAdam Barzilay studied at the culinary school in Israel and worked as a pastry chef at some of the leading restaurants there, including Toto, and Herbert Samuel at the Ritz Carlton in Tel Aviv. He honed his skills staging in the Provence region of France, in a Michelin star country restaurant, and attending a Chocolatier school. Currently, Adam is the head Pastry chef for the Shile Restaurant Group, which encompass some of the best restaurants in Tel Aviv: Shila, Caf\u00e9 Europa, Shipudey Europa, Europa Gelatery, and Florentine house. Adam\u2019s family is originally from Yemen, and he grew up savoring all the traditional Jewish-Yemenite foods, such as Jahnun, Mala\u2019uah, Kubana, and Ox-tail soup.\n \nYaron Amar studied at the culinary school in Israel, staged in Italy and at the 3 Michelin stars Lameloise in Bourgogne. Worked at some of the leading Israeli restaurants including Roshfeld and Roshfeld Bistro in Tel Aviv where he eventually became the head chef. Currently, Yaron is the Chef de Cuisine at Shila, the leading Israeli seafood restaurant in Tel Aviv, and part of the same Shile Restaurant Group where Adam Barzilay is working. Besides Israeli cuisine, Yaron has specialized in butchery and French and Italian cuisines. He is passionate about the Moroccan cuisine of his family roots. Growing up, he was inspired by his hardworking Mom, cooking some divine traditional signature dishes such as couscous, and fish in spicy sauce. And his dad helping at times with his own Moroccan specialties, such as his delicous Matbu\u2019ha.\n \nRon Gibori is the nephew of Toro Bravo Inc business partner Ron Avni and has been our main Israeli restaurant coordinator during our own chefs\u2019 visits in Israel. Gibori opened his own restaurant, Jeremiah, in Tel Aviv at the exact same month in which we opened our first restaurant, Toro Bravo. (He sold Jeremiah two years ago.) Ron studied at the culinary school in Israel, won top sommelier at Israel's wine expo, and worked at some of the leading restaurants in Israel, such as Roshfeld, Catit and Seatara, either as a front of house manager or as general manager. Gibori grew up in Vered HaGalil, the charming guest ranch that was founded by his grandfather, Yehuda Avni, and has been a source of inspiration for some of the dishes and themes at both Mediterranean Exploration Company and at Shalom Y\u2019All."},{"id":627763054075528,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.16.302.173\/p206x206\/15965928_807990459339959_7222915755876442566_n.jpg?oh=38c89f63c69b6e7aa87a62097cfbac39&oe=5901C753","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c24.0.210.210\/s173x172\/1422_283997225072621_988489664_n.jpg?oh=c5e13b151cc2216bcb56cc10cd55db37&oe=59171C2F","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/627763054075528\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Screening: Julie Perini's They have a name for girls like me","day":"27","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Jan 27 - Jan 28","location":"Upfor\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"64 people interested","description":"\u201cThey have a name for girls like me\u201d is a two-day screening of an ongoing, experimental video of the same title by moving-image artist Julie Perini.\n\nSCHEDULE FOR SATURDAY, JANUARY 28\nSit-down screening: 11:15 am\nArtist talk with Julie Perini: 12:15 pm\nSit-down screening: 1:15 pm\nScreening will continue on a loop until the gallery closes at 6:00 pm\n\nUsing excerpted material from nearly 40 films spanning cultures and decades, Perini searches global fiction narrative filmmaking for an archetypal \u201cJulie,\u201d ulitmately exploring the history of representation of women in cinema, notions of gender as performance and ideas about cinematic identification.

Kauffman's latest curatorial endeavor features eleven artists whose work relays discreet narratives through the use of pointed imagery and stunning technique. Hand selected by Kauffman himself, each artist hails from the tradition of folk, frequently expressing emotion and weaving captivating tales that compels the viewer to search beyond the surface and discover secrets lying within.  \n\nIn the curator's own words: \"'LEAN In CLOSER' looks at artists who evoke visual narratives in their work, each telling stories with his or her unique vernacular. Through suggestion, color, repetition, and a familiar hand, these makers push their respective genres forward while honoring the tradition of folk. 'Lean In Closer' is hence a suggestion to look more closely at these stories.\"\n\n'LEAN in CLOSER' features Ryan Bubnis, Ian Ferguson, Lori Field, Evan B. Harris, Andrea Joyce Heimer, Max Kauffman, Troy Lovegates, Jaime Molina, Kreh Melick, Stacy Rozich, and Betsy Walton.\n\nThe opening reception for 'LEAN in CLOSER' will be held at Stephanie Chefas Projects on Friday, January 27th from 7-10pm. Exhibition curator Max Kauffman and select feature artists will be in attendance. Stephanie Chefas Projects is located in Portland, Oregon at 305 SE 3rd Avenue on the second floor of the Urban Row building. The exhibition will be on view through February 24th, 2017 and is free and open to the public.\n\nFor more info or art inquiries, please contact info\u0040stephaniechefas.com"}],"paginationCursor":"eyJzdGFydF90aW1lIjoxNDg1NTA0MDAwLCJlbmRfdGltZSI6MTQ4NTU5MDM5OSwiYnJvd3NlX2N1cnNvciI6IkFicWl5dW5QRmI4TFRuTkhXYTFMWER0VGVXNzRMa3AwRFY3M2kxbTNBRFNjaTNEN1JFaENGSndRNGZmSTRJckJFbWJBbThaT0xvMVdpQlR6bVJaMjZVa1FLUEdIMGM4TFNGazZCSUZqX1lKU3FuUlI5MjRidnpYMlJuTXJwRVM1SUlpbGtRanpoVXlreXcyMXhCalQ4aWtKNW9YY1Z2YTMyWkxtdGh3SkZka21mNktidVJvVFhMR3E5RHVfbEVJbVBrSDNHZEE4RWI0SHIxSE0zcGNIdWJ4Y1AzMkFJWFNSemZ6cmxjNTctRDBWdFZWNjBrcTJteXZBSHY1UnFvTVZHMHgyeURsMHA4WnFaZERaazZiUTJuTmFCVlk0S19LVzhEb3NkamxDUkQtQ3hnIn0=","hasNextPage":true}],"isGroupedList":false},"bootloadable":{},"ixData":{},"lid":"6378508559178193666"}

The studio provides yoga mats, blankets, a variety of meditation and practice pillows, and eye pillows.\n\n\"The sound of the gong allows us to move beyond the boundaries of the mind. We have used our mind since birth to perceive the world and through our mind we have constructed our own unique version of reality. Over time we have become habituated with a set of perceptual responses to the incoming data from the world outside our mind. These responses layer and layer upon each other and build up their own magnetic frequency. This magnetic frequency then radiates out from us and attracts similar frequencies. Like attracts like. This is why the change process is so difficult. We can add information. We can add knowledge. We think we know more, and we do. But we have not really changed. Our energetic being remains the same. Our basic magnetic frequency and our layered perceptual filters process the new information in the old habitual ways. New information does not change us. An energetic shift of our magnetic field changes us.\" -Harijiwan Singh\n\nDoors open 7:00pm\n$18 in advance, $25 drop-in\nRegister: www.MandalaYogaPDX.com"},{"id":300602983674083,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.465.860.311\/s480x480\/15697906_1312951368776693_1978846390643873042_n.jpg?oh=b80eee86a49c40f1055b3bee434fe878&oe=591FB68C","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Down Gown record release, Queen Chief, Excuses","day":"27","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Fri 9 PM","location":"World Famous Kenton Club\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"86 people interested","description":"Come help Down Gown celebrate the release of their self-titled debut album on Cavity Search Records.

An orchestra for the Soul and Heart! I sat towards the back and I still heard and felt the vibrations clearly. Clear enough to easily enter altered state, here Nicole's guided mediation, Sarah's angelic voice and cello playing is truly gifted, a conduit for deep Healing, connection to the Higher Realms, and Remembrance! She anchored me deeper into my Truth and brought in clarity to the initial vision that rolled in for me when Nicole and Kevin played the bowls and gongs; which they play beautifully together! The entire sounds weaved together harmoniously as a professional orchestra does, so I think $30 for this event is a huge gift to us! My almost 10yr old child was there too , went feeling a little sick, and she left feeling better! She enjoyed all of it, and it wasn't too long even for her.\n-Rose\n\n\n********************************\n::BIO::\nNicole Alcyon is a Certified Hypnotherapist, Intuitive Sound Healer, and Angel Therapy Practitioner\u00ae and channels her Higher Self and the Divine within each of her sessions. This is achieved simply by allowing her Higher Self to come forth through the words spoken and the energy shared. The intention for these high vibrational Hypno-Chakra and\/or Sound Healing Sessions is to provide the opportunity to strengthen our connection and alignment to our Higher Self, allowing for our greater potential to unfold within this lifetime.

Come be reminded of the hits and high energy performances that brought the Chili Pepper's international acclaim! Having performed many of the country's most prestigious concert halls as well as every major tribute festival, the Red Not's sincere devotion to that classic Chili Pepper sound is filling venues and rocking people's socks off around the US and abroad. With the ability to span over thirty years of hits and hundreds of songs, every show provides a unique, high energy, and organic live music experience.Formed in 2009, the Red Not Chili Peppers have quickly risen to be the Nation's most active Chili Pepper tribute while also reaching international markets in Brazil, Mexico, and Japan. With top musicians hailing from as far as Milan Italy, the Red Not's have stopped at nothing to develop the most accurate re-creation of that distinctive alternative funk rock sound everyone knows to be Red Hot Chili Peppers. Start with musicians who grew up heavily influenced by RHCP with an uncanny physical resemblance, mix in the ability to deliver a truly explosive performance, and you have all the ingredients for a world class tribute act. The Red Not's will always deliver that raging party everyone expects from a Chili Pepper show!\nTickets:\nhttp:\/\/www.ticketweb.com\/fb\/7088685\/dante"},{"id":875056555931277,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.81.480.173\/p320x320\/15965235_1847000335571419_4459316217943660463_n.jpg?oh=71fb101b026a4e22033b47ffac0b6436&oe=591D9E61","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"The Adventures Of Walter and Bruce","day":"27","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Jan 27 - Jan 29","location":"The Circus Project\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"21 people interested","description":"This is a work in progress showing of a new work by White Collar Crimes called: \n\nThe Adventures Of Walter and Bruce\n\nPresented as part of Fertile Ground Festival\nFestival Dates: Jan 27, 28, 29 \u0040 8pm \nRuntime: 30 mins\n\nJoin Walter and Bruce in their second Fertile Ground Performance!

Where and Why Did It Begin? What Is Life? Why Are You Here? Our world needs TOaEs to approach these big  questions and to integrate medicine and psychology, Aboriginal shamanistic religions, quantum theory, and relativity. \n\nWho are we? What happened at the beginning of the universe 13.8 billion years ago, before the BIG BANG? Scientists seek answers but don\u2019t know for sure. An earlier Pope told cosmologist Stephen Hawking, \u201cdon\u2019t think about what happened before the big bang!\u201d  Was the Pope right? well\u2026\n\nTo answer how, when and why you and I originated, we need a missing \u201cTOE\u201d, a \u201cTheory of Everything,\u201d for these \u201cbig\u201d questions. A \u201cTOE\u201d would bring together the universe\u2019s space with the tiny, microscopic spaces of particles. A TOE might unify psychology, medicine and religion.\n\nPerhaps processwork can help? January classes approach \u201cTOaEs\u201d in a way that will help with personal life, with dreams and body work, medicine and the meaning(s) of life.  We will develop processwork ideas connected to quantum theory (I\u2019ll make it simple), and the sense of the \u201cGods.\u201d  New ideas may appear about birth and death, unusual states of consciousness, and how our universe began.\n\nClass 1. Before the Big Bang. Processwork\u2019s \u201cBig TOaE\u201d, Quantum \u201cWoo\u201d, and consciousness.\nClass 2. Your Body\u2019s Medicine From the Universe\u2019s Quantum \u201cWoo.\u201d\nClass 3. Lucid Living, and Possible Reasons Why We are Here\n**Note, a (TOE) is normally a physics term for putting together Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity for our universe and quantum theory\u2019s world of particles and waves.

Recently quantum physicists stated that we see less than .01\u0025 of what is around us. As a left brained dominate culture we are blind. Worlds and non- physical beings exist that are unseen to our eyes but not to our knowingness.\n\nJourneying is an immeasurable tool that brings these worlds and non-physical beings to life. Through the Rabbit Hole, the name of LightSong\u2019s Level 1 basic journey class, is the beginning place for an experiential transformation that is beyond words.  There are no prerequisites for this class except for curiosity, wonder, desire, longing, and readiness.\n\nThe unfulfilled feelings that many people have are from their disconnect with the non-physical or spirit worlds.  Fulfill your dreams, your purpose, your longings and get in touch with what is provided through life in the other 99\u0025 of what exists. If you are one of those that say, I\u2019ll believe it when I see it, suspend your disbelief, and jump into the Rabbit Hole with me as your guide.\n\nJourneying is the foundational tool for shamanic study and healing, and provides the passageway used for centuries to obtain information from other realities. \n\nYou will begin to build a partnership with the spirits through journeying. Through the journeying process, you connect with power animals and spiritual teachers. They share with you information, knowledge and wisdom for solving problems, gaining clarity about life\u2019s circumstances, and for building your awareness and understanding of the different worlds beyond.\n\nIn this course, you also explore a central theme of \u201cwho are you?\u201d This theme launches you on a potent and essential shamanic inquiry\u2013the quest for your true self. Journeys on this theme lead you on a magical and intentional discovery of self, of self in relation to the spirits and the divine.\n\nUsing the shamanic journey technique, you are guided to a remembering of your radiance. The entire LightSong School of Shamanic Studies program is based on this rediscovery, and so we begin our inquiry in this course.\n\nJan\u2019s book, Through the Rabbit Hole: Explore and Experience the Shamanic Journey and Energy Medicine is a wonderful companion text for this course.  It elaborates on and reinforces the material and exercises presented in the class.\n\nHere\u2019s what people are saying about Level 1:\n\n\n\u201cI want to thank Jan for the beautiful gifts of the Basic Shamanic Journey Skills class weekend. The authentic joy and resonating sense of well-being I felt was both electrifying and grounding. I am permanently changed.\u201d SS\n\n\u201cThe Basic Shamanic Journey Skills class was so incredible and because of this workshop, I have had the largest spiritual shift in my life to date. Jan and my fellow students filled a deep longing in my soul and I am permanently changed.\u201d JM"},{"id":1249924921720117,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.25.959.347\/s480x480\/15781276_1421978004493169_8772436162160163946_n.jpg?oh=6a5f2ec383f650e98194bf5ea946f13e&oe=59016955","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"2017 Winter Masquerade Ball","day":"27","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Fri 8 PM","location":"Hope For Widows & Orphans\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Hillsboro","socialContext":"99 people interested","description":"GRAB YOUR TICKETS HERE >> http:\/\/bit.ly\/2jxBxjY\n\nWe are proud to announce that Hope For Widows and Orphans will be hosting our 3rd annual Winter Masquerade ball.

Living in such remote areas spurred Mack's appreciation for the City life and Graffiti Art. After moving to the heart of Seattle in 2012, Mack began to refine his art style through spray paint and stencils. Artists that inspire Mack for his unique style include Banksy, Shepard Fairy and Lora Zombie. It was just in the past year after moving to Camas Mack began to work with watercolors. In addition to Graffiti Art, Mack's work includes Art Deco, Steam Punk and Nautical Themes.\n\nStop in to Amnesia Brewing on Friday January 27th from 5-9pm Have a pint with Mack and maybe take home a piece of Mack's work!"},{"id":359779157728677,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.104.947.342\/s480x480\/15977225_732709763549734_5841584155877237177_n.jpg?oh=8af7039038ea50e94350ca612a0bf6f3&oe=5915481E","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"AIA Portland EPC Happy Hour at C2K Architecture!","day":"27","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Fri 5:30 PM","location":"C2K Architecture\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"39 people interested","description":"The AIA Portland Emerging Professionals Committee (EPC) Happy Hour Series continues in 2017, kicking off on January 27th with hosts C2K Architecture!

A high-octane mixture of classic Western Swing and Honky-tonk, the band's hour and a half long sets are legendary for their top-notch musicianship, acrobatic solos and deep, heartfelt vocals ranging from cry-in-your beer weepers to uptempo rave-ups. Drawing from the classic repertoire of 30's-60's Country Western and Swing, the Portland Playboys feature some of the best instrumentalists 'Our Fair City' has to offer; Ian Miller on lead guitar, Rusty Blake on steel, 'King' Keith Brush on slap bass, James Mason on fiddle, and Portland legend Pete Krebs on vocals and rhythm guitar. If you're craving some old school Western Swing for your drinking, dining and dancing pleasure, you can't go wrong with the Portland Playboys."},{"id":1611199259188353,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/q87\/c0.97.960.347\/s480x480\/15822614_10154875232096796_9091463204693413958_n.jpg?oh=56c2ab69510a5e86dc41aba81694cb46&oe=5908AE68","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"PTSA Family Arts & Science Night- Science of the Theater","day":"27","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Fri 6 PM","location":"Chinook Elementary School\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Vancouver, WA","socialContext":"9 people interested","description":"Join us as Chinook PTSA presents a night of exploration into various art forms, and the science that make up production of theater, and movies.

These two performances will be featuring the music from their new album \u201cConvivencia\u201d (coexistence), which is the group\u2019s debut album and Boyd\u2019s first new album in over a decade. Flamenco Pacifico also comprises guitarist and vocalist Grant Ruiz, percussionist Terry Longshore, and dancer Elena Villa. Additionally, there are two special guest artists joining the group from Santa Barbara: Randy Tico on Fretless Bass and Ryan Zerme\u00f1o Flamenco dancer and percussionist. \n\nTrue to the spirit of flamenco, Flamenco Pacifico\u2019s name reflects both geographical place and the idea that flamenco is expansive and inclusive enough to absorb the personal experiences and backgrounds of anyone who wants to participate in the art form. With collective musical influences as diverse as Brazilian jazz, western classical, and Middle Eastern, Flamenco Pacifico offers their unique version of modern flamenco with a world orientation.\n\nWhat also sets this group apart artistically is that their music is based around melodic themes\u2013both in Boyd\u2019s original compositions and in the group\u2019s arrangements of traditional pieces. These thematic elements function as landmarks on the listener\u2019s journey through a musical landscape that can be haunting and deeply moving, due in no small part to the spine-tingling duende, or trance-like spirit unleashed by the music. The festive strains of many of Boyd\u2019s lighter, or chico, compositions also assure that even after the last chords of the guitar have faded, audiences will walk away from the performance with an infectious melody in their ears.\n\nFlamenco Pacifico has performed in a variety of venues\u2013from intimate house concerts to major festivals such as the Britt Music and Arts Festival (Jacksonville, OR), the Oregon Shakespeare Festival\u2019s popular Green Show (Ashland, OR), and the Oregon Country Fair (Veneta, OR)."},{"id":1620838411554733,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c8.0.476.172\/p173x172\/15941313_10154916122982302_3307885473813664408_n.jpg?oh=a3854ff0d4888199e58ce388ee60509a&oe=59195DCA","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"OPB and Portland Center Stage Advance Screening","day":"27","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Fri 7 PM","location":"Liberty Theater Astoria\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Astoria","socialContext":"34 people interested","description":"Screening Event: Celebrate Astoria with OPB!\n \nDive into the art and history of Astoria with back-to-back screenings celebrating the oldest U.S. settlement in the West.

These two performances will be featuring the music from their new album \u201cConvivencia\u201d (coexistence) and is Boyd\u2019s first album in over a decade. Additionally, this concert will feature two special guest artists joining the group from Santa Barbara: Randy Tico on Fretless Bass and Ryan Zerme\u00f1o Flamenco dancer and percussionist. \n\nTrue to the spirit of flamenco, Flamenco Pacifico\u2019s name reflects both geographical place and the idea that flamenco is expansive and inclusive enough to absorb the personal experiences and backgrounds of anyone who wants to participate in the art form. With collective musical influences as diverse as Brazilian Jazz, Western Classical, and Middle Eastern, Flamenco Pacifico offers their unique version of modern flamenco with a world orientation.\n\nWhat also sets this group apart artistically is that their music is based around melodic themes\u2013both in Berto Boyd\u2019s original compositions and in the group\u2019s arrangements of traditional pieces. These thematic elements function as landmarks on the listener\u2019s journey through a musical landscape that can be haunting and deeply moving, due in no small part to the spine-tingling duende, or trance-like spirit unleashed by the music. The festive strains of many of Boyd\u2019s lighter, or chico, compositions also assure that even after the last chords of the guitar have faded, audiences will walk away from the performance with an infectious melody in their ears.\n\nTogether with the passionate vocals and guitar artistry of guitarist\/singer Grant Ruiz, inspired dancing by Elena Villa, the rhythmical percussion of Terry Longshore, the virtuosic playing of veteran fretless bassist Randy Tico, the dynamic and explosive dancing and caj\u00f3n playing of Ryan Zerme\u00f1o, Flamenco Pacifico takes audiences on an unforgettable journey into the fascinating world of flamenco.\n\nFlamenco Pacifico has performed in a variety of venues\u2013from intimate house concerts to major festivals such as The Britt Festival (Jacksonville, OR), The Oregon Shakespeare Festival\u2019s popular Green Show (Ashland, OR), and the Oregon Country Fair."},{"id":237028700057361,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.372.480.173\/p480x480\/15826371_10154999671395854_5510839881438395206_n.jpg?oh=6bb539a8258d4c55e316b9eb808371e2&oe=5922FA03","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Mitten Puppet Show","day":"27","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Jan 27 - Jan 28","location":"Tumwater Timberland Library\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Tumwater, WA","socialContext":"11 people interested","description":"Age Group: Children 3-6 years, Children grades 1-3\nRipples Puppet Theatre presents a puppet show based on the Ukrainian folktale, \"The Mitten\".

It\u2019s a place that provides for and shapes our expression of security, identity, and even play. But an estimated 100 million people around the world lack shelter altogether, and as many as one billion lack adequate permanent housing. In the US, families with children are the fastest-growing segment of the homeless population. How does homelessness affect the lives of all people within a community? What does it mean for there to be masses of people who are not adequately housed? \n\nThis is the focus of \u201cHomeless in the Land of Plenty,\u201d a free conversation with Ryan Stroud hosted by Astor Library Friends Association and sponsored by Oregon Humanities.\n\nStroud is a storyteller and the founder and director of CommuniTalks, an applied storytelling project that leverages personal narrative to empower individual and social change. He holds an MS in conflict resolution and a BA in communication from Portland State University, and a Diploma with Honors in Mandarin Chinese from the Defense Language Institute. In 2013, he was awarded a Collaborative Governance Service Award from the National Policy Consensus Center for his facilitation work in the field of public policy.\n\nThrough the Conversation Project, Oregon Humanities offers free programs that engage community members in thoughtful, challenging conversations about ideas critical to our daily lives and our state's future. \n\nOregon Humanities (921 SW Washington, Suite 150; Portland, OR 97205) connects Oregonians to ideas that change lives and transform communities.

You\u2019ll learn the importance of good arrangements, production and compositions along with new tips and tricks for your home recording techniques. \n\nIf you wish, you\u2019ll have a chance to play or perform your material in front of our panel of Record Execs with honest feedback from fellow artists at the retreat along with our industry reps to enhance your creativity. Deane and I promise we will give you all of our heart and soul on this weekend and answer all of your questions.\n\nThis retreat is not a seminar:\nThis is not someone just telling stories or talking all weekend.

Attendees become life-long members of each other's trusted music network. \n\nThis will be an experience you\u2019ll never forget and you'll leave with a new level of confidence and feel more inspired than ever before. \nFeel free to share this with whomever you think may be interested.
