The event will take place at 7 p.m. in Copeland Commons Room of TaborSpace, 5441 SE Belmont St., Portland. \n\nA three-member panel will discuss upcoming legislation in the Oregon Legislature\u2019s \u201clong session,\u201d January through June, followed by a question\/answer discussion with the audience.\n\nAngus Duncan, Chair of the Oregon Global Warming Commission, will speak first about legislation that the Commission believes necessary for Oregon to meet its climate goals. Because the Commission recommends statutory and administrative changes, policies, and other actions to be carried out by the state government, it plays a key role in determining measures to be introduced in this legislative session.\n\nSenator Michael Dembrow, representing Oregon\u2019s 23rd District in the Oregon Senate, will give an insider's view of upcoming environmental legislation. Senator Dembrow chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, and is a key Senate leader in determining which legislation will come out of committee for an actual vote on the Senate floor.\n\nFinally, Shilpa Joshi, Organizing Director for Renew Oregon, will address how citizen action can influence pending legislation to enhance its chances of passage. Renew Oregon is a coalition of businesses, non-profits, faith and community organizations which works in the fight against climate change. \n\nThis event is free and open to the public; donations will be gratefully accepted to help defray program expenses.

At times it bears the painterly, frank essence of a Blue\/Court and Spark Joni Mitchell. At others, it strides toward the progressive and cinematic. There is a striking viscerality in the crashing percussion and detuned piano of \u201cI Am Only A Man\u201d and in the hypnotic woodwind outro of \u201cWhat If I Can.\u201d The mournful guitar dressing \u201cWatercolor Dreams\u201d seems to nod to Ennio Morricone \u2014 like a future-Western ballad. And even in the stark songs that bookend the album, Vidmar delivers swelling sentiment fit for the screen.\n\nDespite its sonic magnitude, Salt never surrenders its intimacy. Salt was self-produced by Vidmar, who also played and recorded the majority of its instrumentation. The beautiful result is a testament to craftsmanship executed almost single-handedly by one author. Rife with tender imperfections, at its core Vidmar\u2019s heartrending vocals are still as silken as ever, as the singer reaches new heights.\n\nLyrically, Vidmar explores the ambiguous territory in which many so-called \u201cmillennials\u201d find themselves, hovering somewhere amidst a pre-internet nostalgia and post-recession tech absorption. He takes an honest and unflinching look at the tension between growth and decay, existential-level FOMO, and the nagging inertia of time.\n\nShy Girls first came to attention in 2013 with his slow burning, sax-tinged \u201cUnder Attack,\u201d followed by the release of his buzzed-about Timeshare EP and subsequent 4WZ mixtape. Vidmar has collaborated with artists such as Cyril Hahn, Tei Shi, Rome Fortune, Antwon, Junglepussy, and ODESZA, and has toured with HAIM, Little Dragon, and Maxwell. Salt is his debut full-length album and will be released on Jan. 20, 2017, via Hit City U.S.A.\n\nTHE LAST ARTFUL, DODGR\nSometimes in life, you come across a voice so present and singular in its tone that it makes your entire world stop for a moment and all the hairs on your neck stand up.  The Last Artful, Dodgr has proven to be one such phenomenon.  \n\nBorn in Los Angeles and currently inhabiting Portland, Oregon - her own unique brand of rap-singing, made up of casually delivered triple entendres, unforgettable melodies and an ever-changing stream of cadences, has begun to spread like a wildfire in recent months.  From her noteworthy singles \"Squadron\" and \"Oofda\" topping Spotify charts, to her manifested-thru-song appearance on the legendary Sway In The Morning radio show, everything has been coming up Dodgr in 2016.  And really, she's only just getting started - with all of this leading up to her forthcoming duo LP, Bone Music, a collaboration with producer Neill Von Tally, due out in early 2017.  \n\nIt's not too early to get in on the ground floor of this star on the rise."},{"id":221769238231993,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-9\/c0.11.450.163\/16105540_1379494232082468_8691477175683010835_n.jpg?oh=1493c06f444a557160e66a77173f9b73&oe=59104353","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"OPEN HOUSE","day":"25","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Wed 10 AM","location":"Everest Institute - Tigard\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Tigard","socialContext":"2 people interested","description":"Everest Institute Tigard Open House.

Working within the intimate intersection of the human body\/breath and the saxophone, Blade of Love is a spiritual and enigmatic work with a deep emotional resonance.\n\nSince forming in 2012, the four saxophonists in Battle Trance (Travis Laplante, Patrick Breiner, Matt Nelson, Jeremy Viner) have spent hundreds of hours deepening their musical connection with each other, maturing as an ensemble through relentless touring everywhere from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, Montreal to Vancouver, and most places in between.\n\nThe three movements of Blade of Love were composed by Battle Trance leader Travis Laplante and recorded by the group in a wooden room with soaring ceilings in the Vermont forest, after spending two years of rigorous rehearsals working to perfect the array of extended techniques, both virtuosic and primal, required to bring the challenging piece to life.\n\nBlade of Love's central focus is on the physical and spiritual intersection of the saxophone and the human body. The saxophone is one of the few instruments that literally enters the body of the person playing it, and Blade of Love is a medium for this sacred meeting place, with each member of Battle Trance using the saxophone as a vessel for the human spirit.\n\nSinging has an inherent power, but that power is heightened in the context of Blade of Love. At times, the four players sing while exhaling through the saxophone tubes, using the instrument's keys to shift the timbre of their voices. Laplante also integrates non-traditional mouth articulations, using the saxophone as a resonant chamber for these inventive sounds. Laplante explains:\n\n\"There were certain specific sounds that I imagined being in Blade of Love, but I couldn't get close enough to them using traditional saxophone tone \u2014 sounds like arrows flying through the air, birds singing or flying overhead, bombs, water running, the wind, fires, singing in church, making love, killing, waves crashing, fighting for your life, thunder, the sound of rage, howling, crying, laughing, the sound of my last breath... So I began working on different ways for the saxophone to get closer to these sounds, and the resulting techniques became part of the fabric of Blade of Love.\"\n\nTravis Laplante describes composing Blade of Love as \"the most torturous and demanding compositional experience of my life.\" He continues: \"It's painful for me to try to explain what this music 'means,' because in a sense it has no meaning \u2014 and at the same time, it means everything. I just hope Blade of Love will release something in both the listener and the performer's hearts. It doesn't ask for anything in return.\"\n\n\nBLUE CRANES\nSince their formation in 2007, Blue Cranes have become a key player in the Portland, Oregon creative music\/DIY scene and one of the most exciting groups to keep tabs on in the Northwest. They've developed a singular musical voice grounded in melody and explosive improvisations--marking off their unique microcosmic territory in post-jazz circles.\n\nThe members of the quintet--Reed Wallsmith on alto saxophone, Joe Cunningham on tenor saxophone, Rebecca Sanborn on keyboards, Jon Shaw on bass, and Ji Tanzer on drums--bring a unique array of experiences to their group-centered aesthetic, including work with AU, The Decemberists, Laura Veirs, Wayne Horvitz, Rebecca Gates, Laura Gibson, Ethan Rose, Pete Krebs, Black Prairie, and Portland Cello Project.\n\nThe band took an evolutionary step forward with the release of Swim, their fourth full-length album, on the Washington, D.C.-based Cuneiform Records. Swim is a departure from Blue Cranes' previous, and in some ways simpler, albums. Steered dutifully by producer Nate Query of The Decemberists, it is a window into the sometimes messy emotional space of a group struggling with and celebrating the ephemeralness of life. This work is the culmination of several between-album projects, including a 30-day crowd-sourced Amtrak train tour in 2011, and a seven day group composition retreat, supported in part by a grant from Portland's Regional Arts and Culture Council. However, the heart of Swim lies in indelibly profound life events--the passing away of two dear friends, a serious injury, two weddings, and the birth of a child--events at tragic and uplifting extremes, both cathartic and celebratory."},{"id":1825952917647159,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.8.828.299\/s480x480\/15267563_1386822874662673_1686979300275157129_n.jpg?oh=8632415d193d423c6e554fe9696612dd&oe=590079C9","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"2017 Point-In-Time Homeless Count","day":"25","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Wed 6 AM","location":"YCAP (Yamhill Community Action Partnership)\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0McMinnville","socialContext":"12 people interested","description":"Join us on JANUARY 25th for the annual Point-In-Time Homeless Count, a day when YCAP joins with every County around the Nation to conduct surveys of persons experiencing homelessness.

Part of a long-term partnership with venue The Steep and Thorny Way to Heaven, this debut workshop performance invites the audience into a world that tears down the walls between fantasy and reality, between seeing a show and becoming a part of it.\n\nPerformers: \nPortland based goth-rocker Myrrh Larsen \nand contortionist, aerial performer, and sinferno regular Meg Russell."},{"id":1698569920433030,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.97.960.347\/s480x480\/15977913_682163818611541_4318984207250619385_n.jpg?oh=e912525b11c43b61f3970983abc2131d&oe=59243D2D","width":476,"height":172},"morePhoto":null,"title":"Nursing Informatics: Best Practices for Engagement","day":"25","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Wed 5 PM","location":"Kells Irish Restaurant & Pub\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"","description":"Join HIMSS Oregon for this evening event, \"Nursing Informatics: Best Practices for Front Line User Engagement & Communications,\" to hear from distinguished members of the informatics community, including Kaiser, Providence and OHSU, and to learn the latest methods for improving adoption and efficiency of EHR's.

Every actor\u2019s and director\u2019s nightmare is realized, to side-splitting comic effect.\n\nA cast of nine actors\u2014five men and four women\u2014are kept furiously busy on a multi-doored, two story set that revolves to show the audience what happens backstage as well as onstage. In three short acts, Noises Off reveals the play-within-the-play at dress rehearsal, a month later, and toward the end of its 10-week tour of small town English theaters. It seems that anything that can go wrong does, as the hapless actors teeter through the show from its shaky beginning to its final, hilarious conclusion.\n\n\u201cPentacle\u2019s 2001 production of Noises Off was a smash hit that sold out quickly,\u201d said director Susan Schoaps. \u201cThis show is sure to do the same, so get your tickets now before it\u2019s too late.\u201d.\n\nWhat: Noises Off is written by Michal Frayn and directed by Susan Schoaps.

A consummate performer, GitDown never maps out his set ahead of time, opting to craft sets spontaneously from within the context they are intended for. This improvisational element makes each of his sets a one of a kind personal expression, never again to be repeated. A strong force in the northwest music scene for over a decade and a half now, GitDown is never locked down by one genre of music. Justin simply says, \"I like to play really good music of all sorts\". GitDown rocks crowds from outdoor summer massives to small town dive bars with inventive and progressive ways to mix it all together for a pleasurable smooth blend with heavy bass lines and epic drops.\n \" He's Fun, he's Dirty, he's Funky, he Rocks the F^*#!n Crowd every time.\"\n\t\tURL's-Dj GitDown:\nhttps:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/sh\/xbqmyix20sbnw1h\/cD1hS3PrDw = Press Kit\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DjGitDown.USA\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Official.DjGitDown.Page\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/gitdown\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/djgitdown\nhttp:\/\/www.reverbnation.com\/djgitdown\nhttp:\/\/instagram.com\/djgitdown\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/Dj_GitDown\nhttps:\/\/myspace.com\/djgitdown\nhttp:\/\/www.ustream.tv\/user\/DjGitDown\nhttp:\/\/db.tt\/qj6hQAjZ = Add Drop Box\nhttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/u\/0\/+JustinDown-DjGitDown\/\nhttp:\/\/checkoutmyink.com\/profile\/dj_gitdown"}],"paginationCursor":"eyJzdGFydF90aW1lIjoxNDg1MzMxMjAwLCJlbmRfdGltZSI6MTQ4NTQxNzU5OSwiYnJvd3NlX2N1cnNvciI6IkFib09hTzVCOU82bTBHZkhaTEVUNkpyZllreUYwcmJDMzRtRGwzaTFUcnJQX0tFWERFbDI4VFI2V3RDTVdfU2d6R2J6cGNFUWpKVV9yY0JQcGtBY3hhYi01S3RMMWlDZEtIekFmVHRoVFlGSmJsQ2JNcHdBcl9qM2ZsQlpXc2t6eTNvMWFGTFZwSXZNQTJZQjlKYy1ITlRJYmt2dldJZnd1bVF2WHh2a2ZyZHBiaVJ0WG9fOW9XUEFvZzNGMG8zbjRFWjZTUDNCcTh1YW8tUEZvbFpFVHItMlRHMmZXTWw2ZjctVDYwa3EzQkdhQlNZQUpNUEJ1amtOc2VNQU5qaWtMTnhONTl3MERVZlJrMlphMkUwa05yZmVqRXR4aWlUQ3ZEb3FoWnZXbzJ4ekpBIn0=","hasNextPage":true}],"isGroupedList":false},"bootloadable":{},"ixData":{},"lid":"6378503710637263963"}

The play tells the story of citizens in an unnamed country that is recovering from the after-effects of a violent dictatorship.\n\nSet in a country that is transitioning to democracy, Death and the Maiden explores how -- and if -- a nation can start to heal its wounds after years of living in a dictatorship regime. Gerardo and Paulina are married, and have finally started to relax after years of living in fear. Gerardo, a lawyer, has just accepted a post as the head of a citizenship committee that will investigate the past crimes of the dictatorship. Unfortunately, the committee will not be able to publicly name the criminals, and no one will be prosecuted, as a result. Gerardo feels that the committee will be a way for the country to peacefully transition to the new government, but his wife Paulina has other ideas of justice. Paulina is traumatized by her past: she was kidnapped, tortured, and raped by members of the former regime.  Determined to administer justice for herself, she takes matters into her own hands and makes sure her torturer pays for his former sins.  Death and the Maiden is a political and moral thriller that examines the psychological aftereffects of human rights abuses.\n\nThis play contains adult themes and language and is not suitable for younger audiences.  Please note a firearm will be discharged during the performance.\n\n$15 in our McTavish Room.  Tickets available on TicketsWest or in our Box Office, Wed-Sat 2-5:30pm."}],"paginationCursor":"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","hasNextPage":true}],"isGroupedList":false},"bootloadable":{},"ixData":{},"lid":"6378503764972620003"}

Her voice has the power to move mountains, or to move grown men to tears. Her songs can transport listeners from lush green forests to dimly-lit juke joints. An Oregonian native, Moorea has been performing professionally since the age of 15. She attended the Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts and studied with Flamenco musicians while living in the cave dwellings of Granada, Spain. Influenced by soulful folk music across generations and geography, including Etta James, Feist, and Iron and Wine. In her former project, The Ruby Pines, she performed at venues like The Blue Note in New York City and The Wonder Ballroom in their home of Portland, Oregon. Currently, she sings with Ural Thomas and The Pain (Willamette Week's Best New Artist in 2014), a throwback soul band fronted by a former collaborator of James Brown and Otis Redding. Moorea is completing work on her debut solo EP, due to be released later this year.\n\nOrkis:\nThe new musical project of Joseph from House of Aquarius.\n\nDashenka:\nDashenka and her music were born in Moscow, Russia and is now living and thriving in Portland, Oregon. This music is a little boat. Get in, take off your shoes if you are wearing any, and go away for a little while. Though a bit foggy and dreamy, the undulations will eventually bring you back to shore.\n\nDashenka has performed in bands such as Radiation City, Brainstorm and Sara Jackson-Holman."},{"id":1900428696859124,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.192.320.183\/p320x320\/15977628_10210891273253941_2090545655153485425_n.jpg?oh=97904e0667732b1fc32daa9b96a51b75&oe=5914D05E","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c50.162.429.429\/s173x172\/12107731_10205328845888266_4212158363597101694_n.jpg?oh=25c9fd36ea797eeb60ef3448d3e1e750&oe=5908E4BE","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/1900428696859124\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"House Call at Analog Cafe main room with Jason Hodges!","day":"26","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Thu 9 PM","location":"Analog Cafe & Theater\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"137 people interested","description":"JASON HODGES (BORDER PATROL)\n\nCanadian born Jason Hodges first arrived in the house music scene in late 1991, taking on Toronto's underground party scene he developed his\nDJing skills on the decks with the likes of New York - New Jersey sounds.

The geographical change doesn\u2019t help the two to see more eye to eye. Practical joker Winfried loves to annoy his daughter with corny pranks.

Bonded by isolation, house party debauchery, a religion based on pushing the limits of bad taste, and a precocious predisposition towards the Kinks, the Animals and the Velvets, they have burgeoned into a rock and roll act to be reckoned with. As the hysteria at their local shows steadily increases, so does their reputation with local law enforcement, forcing them daily more to seek employment anywhere but home. While snooping cops seeking to stamp out indiscriminate behavior scour the borders of their homestead the Nude Ranch, the group has prodigally exiled themselves and are staying scarce with a string of self booked tours and one night stands which have linked them up with with such likes as The Growlers, The Oblivians, La Luz, Night Beats, and King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard. \nTheir stripped down and bare bone sound, akin to the British Invasion being transplanted back into the Carolina mountains, has so far proven to have been unrecordable\u2026 until now. The secret? Sticking to the obvious and going down into a sweaty basement with a few mics, fewer clothes and a revolving door of comrades and goddesses falling by for as long as they can take the heat. Lately the Nudes have even gotten good at playing with their clothes on. However if any audience member feels the need to participate in the spirit of exhibitionism the stakes at the Party will unblinkingly be called and raised.\n\nhttps:\/\/thenudeparty.bandcamp.com\/\n\nThe Reverberations\nJangly Garage Psych harkening back to the golden age of fuzztones, farfisas, beatle boots, and angry teenagers obsessed with the Beatles.\n\nthereverberations.bandcamp.com\n\nThe Mean Reds\nThe newest all-girl garage combo!

Participants will see the fascial tissues in context and how they are interdependent with the other body systems.\n\nFrom there we begin to appreciate how the body incorporates the Anatomy Train Lines to create easy and graceful movement \u2013 provided they are in some form of balance and harmony; restriction or weakness in one section can have many knock-on effects elsewhere. This workshop will show you how that happens, how to trace the lines of strain and, most importantly, some strategies to deal with them.\n\nThis is the first workshop to combine Anatomy Trains theory alongside structural and functional anatomy and analysis. It blends the concepts of tensegrity with elastic recoil for movement efficiency and illustrates how we use the Anatomy Trains as lines of force transfer.\n\nWe will address differential diagnosis to help identify motor control or soft tissue restrictions and where they may be coming from \u2013 we will show you the interdependent relationships between many of the tissues and how they interact.\n\nThis exciting and fun workshop is delivered with clarity and with your practice in mind \u2013 you will have useful and usable skills by the end of the four days. \n\nIn the first 2-day section of this workshop we will introduce you to the first four main lines \u2013Superficial Front and Back, Lateral and Spiral. For each of the lines we will teach you a range of movement assessments and you will learn the basics of Fascial Release Technique.\n\nThe second section will cover the remaining Anatomy Train lines (Deep Front Line, Arm and Functional Lines) and allow deeper exploration of the main concepts behind the whole system \u2013 structural and functional analysis and refining fascial touch skills.\n\nResearch will be referenced showing the roles of fascia in the body, making this an up-to-date and highly effective skill-building workshop. This will include a synthesis of Robert Schleip\u2019s work on how we can affect the fascia through stimulating different mechanoreceptors. Further, we will draw from the approaches of many other top researchers and practitioners from across the world of fascial manipulation and functional anatomy.\n\nLearn to see and correct the myofascial patterns of the body \u2013 by gradually building BodyReading skills you will learn to interpret movement and postural patterns. We all want to have a 3-dimensional vision of the body and this workshop is the first step towards establishing those skills for yourself.\n\nStrategies \u2013 we will teach you to reliably connect with the fascial tissues, the many ways in which you can mobilise them and, most importantly, the reasons why you would do it and when. A range of powerful techniques will be presented in the context of their structural and functional influences making this a unique workshop that will lead you to the deeper skills explored through the rest of the series.\n\nLearn the full system \u2013 Following on from the Anatomy Trains workshop we offer a Structural Bodywork and Structural Integration training. The next step on both paths is the FRSB series of workshops that will give you the latest research information and put it in a useable context, making sure that you can be maximally effective in our application of fascial release. The world of myofascial anatomy is quickly expanding and we aim to keep you up to date if not ahead of the curve.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nReview of the AT lines in static posture and introduce functional movement assessment.\nBuilds on the skills and knowledge of Anatomy Trains by developing Fascial Touch skills\nBodyReading areas shown in detail, making you ready to explore the body through the FRSB series\nLearn to utilise the power of the DASIE model of touch\nMovement analysis will be utilised to further aid the vision of the fascial layers gliding and the roles of the \u2018locals\u2019 and \u2018expresses\u2019\nWe will add the concepts of \u2018cylinders\u2019 to the BodyReading and use it to look at the trunk in particular\nTo give more familiarity to the use of Bend, Tilt, Shift, Rotate and how they relate to the body positioning along with developing Fascial Touch Skills.\nTo relate the BodyReading to Fascial Release principles of assisted and resisted releases, movement of planes of tissue, separation\/differentiation of planes, relaxation of tension and using Schleip\u2019s mechanoreceptor model to communicate different intents.\nTo relate global and local tensegrity \u2013 expresses vs locals \u2013 AT lines vs single muscles, and to understand the necessity of balancing locally as well as the overall posture\n \n\nLEARNING ENVIRONMENT:\n\nIllustrated lecture\nOpen inquiry atmosphere; questions encouraged; high degree of vitality and humour\nParticipants will exchange palpation and practice BodyReading (visual assessment) on one another under supervised analysis of instructor and assistants.\nWHO IS THIS WORKSHOP FOR?\n\nAnatomy Trains is the perfect introduction to myofascial anatomy for any manual therapist. It is also the first essential step along the path to training in Structural Integration with the Anatomy Trains protocol (Kinesis Myofascial Integration).\n\nFunctional movement assessments and palpation skills are included within the class alongside standing and table based manual therapy. It therefore gives a range of skills and a new vocabulary to practitioners of various disciplines.
