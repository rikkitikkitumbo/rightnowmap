The crystal grid amplifies intentions going out as well as supports connecting to clearer guidance coming in. This is an excellent time to connect with guidance, connect deeply with your soul, and to bring that soul light out in service to the world.\n\nWhen we bring together the strong loving presence of a soul family and a large amplified crystal energy field, there is the opportunity to evolve our lives. There is a way of awakening that is not about trying, but about surrendering to an inner knowing of the body and soul, and about receiving and experiencing all the energies and frequencies needed to transform.\n\nIn this process, you have the opportunity to:\n\u2022 upgrade your nervous system,\n\u2022 deepen your connection with Spirit\/God,\n\u2022 expand your acceptance of yourself, others, and what is.\n\nYou have an opportunity to\n\u2022 experience an increased access to guidance,\n\u2022 as well as heightened feelings of peace and joy.\n**********************************************\nGroup gatherings include the sharing of information, a 45-minute activation\/ meditation of actively breathing in the energies and frequencies and then a quiet time of integration and sharing of personal experiences and ways of knowing. Come with a willingness to breath, feel, heal and receive.\n\nWe would be honored to have you join us. Feel free to call if you have any questions. 503-735-3120\nLove and blessings,\nKaruna Tina Britton\n\nAlso, feel free to bring any crystals you would like activated!"},{"id":856903291118279,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.18.960.550\/s320x320\/16105570_1155822354515587_8000250185917797683_n.jpg?oh=090336b5e9aaf2e50757ce3386ae4704&oe=591D983E","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c23.0.203.203\/s173x172\/564896_278781488886349_1577074187_n.jpg?oh=6a75710dfe7030b3542aea31d7720630&oe=59184ABD","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/856903291118279\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Adult Religious Education","day":"24","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Tue 7 PM","location":"Holy Rosary Church\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"","description":"Have you ever wondered what the Church teaches and why?\nWould you like to be able to articulate the teachings of the\nChurch better?

(For more information, see stuartperrin.com .) It is not a physical movement-type yoga class. \n\nYou will be introduced to the 7 major energy centers in the chakra system, instructed in how to work with them, and given a special breathing exercise to use in the open-eye meditation session with the teacher. Energy transmission from the teacher to the students takes place through eye contact and speech.\n\nQuestions will be welcome after the session. Ongoing weekly free classes and quarterly weekend retreats are available for those who wish to pursue this practice of meditation. \n\n$5 donation is requested to help pay the rent, but no one will be turned away for lack of funds. No yoga mats required, cushions and chairs are provided for sitting; wear comfortable clothes.\n\nPlease arrive by 6:30 sharp before meditation begins.\nBeginners welcome!

In 2008, the Board adopted a new Mission Statement and Strategic Plan II, guiding the direction of the school district for the next five years and beyond. The Board also hires the superintendent, who reports directly to the Board.\n\nWhen and where they meet:\n\nGenerally, the Board meets on the second and fourth Tuesday of the month. Most meetings are held at the Center for Educational Leadership, 2921 Falk Road, Vancouver, 98661, beginning at 5:15 p.m. A calendar of board meetings and agendas for upcoming meetings are posted on the district website, www.vansd.org. Additional board meetings and board work sessions may be scheduled throughout the year.\n\nBoard Meeting Minutes:\n\nBoard meeting minutes and Board recaps are posted in the library under the general tab.\n\nHow they govern:\n\nEach board member serves on one or more committees to examine topics before they are put before the Board for a vote. Committees address policy issues and cover topics such as curriculum and facilities. What may appear to be quick acceptance or denial of a policy at the public board meeting, often is proceeded by hours, weeks, or even months of discussion and revisions at the committee level.\n\nAnnually, board members select a president and vice-president. The board president oversees the board meetings, using a parliamentary procedure. Meetings are open to the public and the media. Exceptions are executive sessions, which are limited by law to discussions that concern issues regarding legal matters, personnel, or property, in which public disclosure would be damaging to individuals or the general welfare of the district.\n\nEligibility:\n\nBoard members are elected by the public to serve four-year terms. To be eligible to fill any of the five board positions, a person must reside within the school district boundaries and be a registered voter. If a board member leaves during a term, a replacement is chosen to fill that position until the next general board election.\n\nAddressing the Board:\n\nThe Board welcomes comments from parents, students, and community members. Comments may be submitted through the Superintendent\u2019s office by letter or by e-mail.\n\nConcerns or issues should be brought to district staff members prior to going before the Board in a public meeting. If satisfaction is not achieved at the school level from the principal, a central office administrator should be contacted. When an issue has not been resolved at these levels, it should be communicated to the Board of Directors.\n\nPublic comments are taken at a designated time during the board meeting. Sign-up sheets are available at the meeting for those who wish to address the Board. When called to speak, go to the podium and state your name and address into the microphone. Comments are limited to three minutes. The Board will not make decisions regarding those comments during the meeting."},{"id":408637612811842,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c181.0.300.172\/p173x172\/16114120_1405880692797844_3683587090762196483_n.jpg?oh=be5dded14305aeb424b91c33544fef37&oe=59159C33","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c60.129.520.520\/s173x172\/15170762_1356738704336858_8102575014416626271_n.jpg?oh=dfe0614159b7d192f69a6f4afadba30e&oe=59235E57","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/408637612811842\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Capitalizing on Economic Opportunities in Oregon City","day":"24","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Tue 11:30 AM","location":"Abernathy Chapel\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Oregon City","socialContext":"","description":"Oregon City continues to grow and attract new businesses.

What best practices can help enhance and equalize student success, especially among those from diverse backgrounds? These are just a few of the topics William \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan, a nationally recognized authority on mathematics reform and other critical issues facing higher education, will explore as part of a special lecture.\n\nDr. Kirwan is currently the executive director of the Transforming Post-Secondary Education in Mathematics project, and Chancellor Emeritus of the University System of Maryland (USM). His talk \u201cThe Student Success Imperative: Challenges, Opportunities, and Responsibilities,\u201d comes at an opportune time given the state and national dialogue taking place.\n\nMany contend that mathematics and statistics can make us better thinkers. Kirwan explains that math is not just a linear winnowing process to weed out the (white, male) Einsteins from the masses, but a fundamental tool for all that should be opening more doors than it closes.\n\nThe lecture will be held in the Cascade Ballroom in CH2M Hill Alumni Center at 5 pm with a reception preceding the event at 4:30 pm.

The game originated in China but its exact origins are shrouded in story and myth. Some claim it was the game of Chinese royalty, played in secret to keep the knowledge to themselves. Others claim it was invented by a Chinese General to amuse his troops during long months of battle. More recent investigations point to early versions of this popular tile game appearing as recently as 150 years ago in China as a variant of card games. Whichever story you choose, there is general agreement that the game we play and love originated in China, and popularized in the United States by Joseph Babcock at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThere are several versions of Maajh, but each fall under two broad categories: American Mah Jongg and Chinese Mah Jongg. American Maajh differs from International Maajh in several ways:\n\nIt uses a card of Standard Hands, against which all games are played; these cards are changed annually.\n\nIt uses more tiles, notably the Joker.\n\nThe game is started with \"Charleston\", or the passing of 3 unwanted tiles from one player to another.\n\nIt uses Jokers to complete quints and sextets in several combinations of hands.\n\nMah Jongg is enjoying a resurgence in popularity, with millions of dedicated players around the world and a variety of Internet and computer versions. A very small amount of time and effort is required to become familiar with the elementary principles of the game.Your patience in mastering the fine points of Mah Jongg will be repaid many times by the keen enjoyment invariably derived from the game.\n\nJoin us if you know how to play, would like to learn, or just have a curiosity about these strange Dominos you found in grandma's attic.  Bring your sets and cards if you have them.\n\nDon't worry, all necessary game materials will be available for play at the event.\n\nCall (503) 468-0206 with questions or to RSVP."},{"id":858948577578058,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.8.320.183\/p200x200\/15823162_743491745803979_4855323092075549130_n.jpg?oh=bf78e93efd83c142591a9638d1ffbb2b&oe=591467BB","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c34.0.292.292\/s173x172\/10269481_773546792726975_4207904395101654781_n.jpg?oh=1dc1ec53379fafbf3f4e59309263dc28&oe=58D66256","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/858948577578058\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Cinderella Ballet Fundraiser - McMenamin's Olympic Club","day":"24","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Tue 5 PM","location":"McMenamins Olympic Club\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Centralia, WA","socialContext":"28 people interested","description":"Enjoy an evening of food, fun, entertainment, and surprises, and help Ballet Theatre of Washington get Cinderella to the ball.

Nerburn takes readers inside a Native feast that highlights respect for elders, to a nearly forgotten Nez Perce battlefield, and to both the traditional burial of a young man and the reinterment of the ancient bones of two teen-aged girls. At a dusty roadside cafe he introduces us to an elder who remembers when his ancestors could talk to animals.

Magazine for a special book launch event at Powell's City of Books in Portland!\n\nWe're excited to kick-off the national tour of YES! cofounder and editor-at-large Sarah van Gelder's timely and inspiring new book, The Revolution Where You Live, just published by Berrett-Koehler Publishers [January 2017].\n\nWHAT: National Book Launch \nWHERE: Powell's City of Books, 1005 W Burnside St, Portland, OR 97209\nWHEN: Wednesday, January 25, 7:30pm\nCOST: Free and open to the public\nEVENT LINK: http:\/\/www.powells.com\/eventdetail?popup=true&eventID=789&rwndrnd=0.3082015027842313\n\n\nABOUT THE REVOLUTION WHERE YOU LIVE BOOK:\n\nWith the election of Donald Trump, we know that local resistance and renewal are more vital than ever. The Revolution Where You Live offers an inspiring look into the grassroots movement-building and innovation that is already taking place across the country -- outside of the conventional media view.\n\nThe book traces Sarah's 12,000 mile solo road trip across the U.S. in her tiny truck camper -- through rust belt cities, Native reservations, Appalachia, and the south. Camping along the way, taking time to meet with youth, elders, teachers, artists, activists and other local leaders, Sarah's \"slow journalism\" reporting journey offers a surprising and hopeful window into communities on the rise.\n\n\u201cI love that this book documents the incredibly powerful and dynamic movements that are taking root around the country. Read it!\u201d -- Mark Ruffalo, actor, director, and film producer\n\n\u201cLooking for hope? Here\u2019s where to find it. An inspiring account of the grassroots leaders throughout the United States who are confronting racism, the climate crisis, and poverty.\u201d -- Van Jones, CNN cohost, author, and activist\n\n\u201cJump into Sarah van Gelder\u2019s camper, and you\u2019ll see our country anew . . . just the book Americans need right now.\u201d -- Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9, author of Diet for a Small Planet\n\n\u201cThe Revolution Where You Live couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. If Woody Guthrie had penned a book to go along with \u2018This Land Is Your Land,\u2019 it might have read like this.\u201d -- David Bornstein, New York Times columnist\n\nSarah's national book tour and media events kick off this month. For a full schedule and additional details about the book, see: https:\/\/revolutionwhereyoulive.org\/\n\nABOUT SARAH VAN GELDER\n\nSarah van Gelder is cofounder and editor at large of award-winning YES!

Join us for a seed swap to diversify your seed stock! \n\nFor the seed swap to go well, please do the following:\n\n-- Bring seeds to offer into the swap. It's a seed swap, not a seed giveaway.\n-- While we'd like to focus primarily on vegetables, medicinals and other \"functional\" species, seeds for ornamentals are cool too, if that's you're thing.\n-- Please make sure they're labeled as to species and variety (and also open-pollinated vs. hybrid, if known).\n-- Please don't bring unknown seeds or seeds that are too old to germinate reliably. You could consider seeds that are more than 6 years old to be too old. If your seeds are between 2-4 years old, we may want to combine them with other seeds for making seedballs. \n-- Bring containers to take seeds home in (small jars, empty seed packets, empty teabag packets, etc.)\n\nIf you do not have seeds to share, no problem. Just make sure to save seeds from the seeds you gather and bring them back for next year's seed exchange!\n\nThat's about it! Some masking tape, markers, and other useful tools for labeling seeds will be provided, but feel free to bring your own too.\n\nFeel free to share widely. The more the merrier!\n\nNote: The way the seed exchange will work: ALL seeds will be placed out on tables, by category, and we will observe the honor system. If you have unopened packets of seed that you would like to share part of, please separate out what you want to keep prior to coming. No GMO or fumigated seeds, please!\n\nVolunteers are needed. Please be in touch with Marisha if you would like to lend a hand:  queenbee\u0040herbnwisdom.com."},{"id":356623018044527,"viewer_watch_status":"UNWATCHED","coverPhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c0.0.300.172\/p200x200\/15578859_10153992230966927_1189595161003935318_n.jpg?oh=a0849278bd36857eb47dfab60289afc9&oe=5910C83D","width":300,"height":172},"morePhoto":{"uri":"https:\/\/scontent.fsnc1-5.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.0-0\/c68.26.585.585\/s173x172\/15977591_10154064456361927_1263384874718759815_n.jpg?oh=edcc7119456ceca3a956452fbac1c60e&oe=590DBB5B","width":172,"height":172,"href":"\/events\/356623018044527\/?acontext=\u00257B\u002522action_history\u002522\u00253A\u002522\u00255B\u00257B\u00255C\u002522surface\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522discover_filter_list\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522mechanism\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255C\u002522event_discover_see_more_photo\u00255C\u002522\u00252C\u00255C\u002522extra_data\u00255C\u002522\u00253A\u00255B\u00255D\u00257D\u00255D\u002522\u00257D#EventPhotosOfVenueReactionUnitLoader"},"title":"Happy Hour with \"Astoria\" Creative Team","day":"25","month":"JAN","dateAndTime":"Wed 6:30 PM","location":"Portland Center Stage at The Armory\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Portland","socialContext":"3 people interested","description":"Get a behind-the-scenes scoop on the creation and staging of \"Astoria\" from Assistant Director Brandon Woolley and Dramaturg Ben Fainstein.

The Anarchist Reading Group was created through collaberation between the Portland Anarchist Black Cross and the Anarres Infoshop and Community Space.\r\n\r\nThis months reading will be the essay Listen Marxist! by Murrey Bookchin. This essay is a scathing examination and denunciation of Marxism and the resurgence of Marxist organizations during the struggles of the 1960s and 70s such as SDS or the PLP. Bookchin denounces Marxism's tendancy to look to the past, at revolutionary theories devoleped in scarcity based economy, proposing that in the post-scarcity world of today our struggles must be revised to fit the times. \r\n\r\nWhereas last night we focused the discussion around the rise of Identity Politics and the ally framework, we would like to move our focus towards Marxist organizing today, groups such as the ISO as well as the recent growth of so-called democratic socialist groups like Socialist Alternative and DSA. As anarchists and anti-authoritarians, we must ask ourselves how or if we can organize along side authoritarian groups and how we can best further our struggle against both capitalism and the state in today's political arena.\r\n\r\nA PDF copy of the essay can be found here: http:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/murray-bookchin-listen-marxist\r\n\r\nYou can also come pick up a paper copy from Anarres during our open hours 12-6 Fri-Sun.\r\n\r\nDuring the meeting we will discuss the zine so come prepared with plenty of questions, critiques and highlighted sections for us to explore.\r\n\r\nWe are wheelchair accessible.

The program is a partnership between the city of Beaverton and Unite Oregon (formerly the Center for Intercultural Organizing) and is a key strategy of the Cultural Inclusion Program to boost engagement of underrepresented communities in city government.\n\nPresenter Alexis Ball is the Equity Outreach Coordinator in the Mayor's Office at the City of Beaverton. She coordinates the Cultural Inclusion program, which supports city government in becoming more welcoming, inclusive, representative and responsive to historically underrepresented and underserved communities, particularly communities of color, immigrants and refugees. Alexis comes from a background in the non-profit sector, working in community organizing and advocacy in a variety of settings in the US and Mexico.
